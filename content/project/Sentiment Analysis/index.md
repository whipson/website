In the era of *Big Data*, we are awash in online textual data, such as Tweets, Google Books, and countless blogs. These sources represent a wealth of data. Sentiment analysis is a technique that automatically assesses the emotional content of text. In partnership with Dr. Saif Mohammad of the National Research Council Canada, I'm using sentiment analysis on thousands of online poetry submitted by children and adolescents. The goal of this project is to provide insight into how emotions change over *developmental* time.
