We often think of emotions as being there one moment and gone the next. However, we are always experiencing some sort of emotion - whether it's boiling anger or vapid listlessness. The study of emotion dynamics is all about how emotions change over time. Emotions can change from one moment to the next - intensifying or deintensifying. I'm interested in exploring what predicts these complex changes. In particular, I'm interested in whether solitude impacts our emotional state. 

Extending this further, we can describe change in emotion over *developmental* time as well. For instance, we know that adolescents often experience more intense emotions compared to adults. My work attempts to explore emotion dynamics across multiple time scales.
