Emotion Dynamics tells us that different emotions are highly interconnected, such that one emotion morphs into another and so on. I’ll be using a large dataset from an original study published in PLOS ONE by Trampe, Quoidbach, and Taquet (2015). Thanks to Google Dataset Search, I was able to locate this data. The data is collected from 11,000 participants who completed daily questionnaires on the emotions they felt at a given moment. The original paper is fascinating and I highly encourage checking it out - not to mention that the author’s analysis is the inspiration for this post. The raw data can be freely accessed from the author’s OSF page (link in online article) - props to them for publishing the data!\nWhat is a network? In a sentence, a network is a complex set of interrelations between variables. Some terminology: nodes are the variables (in this case, emotions), and edges are the relationships between the variables. Networks can be directed, which means that variables are linked in a sequence (e.g, from emotion A to emotion B), or undirected, which just shows the relationships. Trampe et al. (2015) created an undirected network in their paper, but the data also allows for a directed network - and this is what I’m going to make for this post.\nFirst, I’ll read in the data and fix up a few spelling errors from the original dataset.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\remotion_raw \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://osf.io/e7uab/download\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(Offense = Ofense,\rEmbarrassment = Embarassment)\remotion_raw\r## # A tibble: 69,544 x 21\r## id Hours Day Pride Love Hope Gratitude Joy Satisfaction Awe\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 2 1 14 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 3 1 14 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 4 1 14 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 5 1 15 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 6 1 15 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 7 1 19 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 8 8 8 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\r## 9 8 9 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\r## 10 8 10 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## # ... with 69,534 more rows, and 11 more variables: Amusement \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Alertness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Anxiety \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Disdain \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Offense \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Guilt \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Disgust \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Fear \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Embarrassment \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Sadness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Anger \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\rThe data is formatted as a sparse matrix (lots of zeros). We have participant id, Day, and Hour that the emotion was reported. To make this data network compatible, I need to wrangle it into a dataframe of edges - that is a from column and a to column. This will become more apparent shortly.\nI can use the function gather to turn the data into long format. By filtering for values of 1, I remove all the zeros from the sparse matrix and I’m left with a column that includes the emotion that was experienced at the time of reporting.\nemotion_long \u0026lt;- emotion_raw %\u0026gt;%\rgather(emotion_type, value, Pride:Anger) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(id, Day) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(value == 1) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-value)\remotion_long\r## # A tibble: 187,426 x 4\r## id Hours Day emotion_type ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 19 1 Offense ## 2 1 19 1 Sadness ## 3 1 14 2 Disgust ## 4 1 15 3 Alertness ## 5 1 15 3 Anxiety ## 6 1 15 3 Embarrassment\r## 7 1 15 3 Sadness ## 8 1 14 4 Alertness ## 9 1 14 4 Embarrassment\r## 10 8 9 2 Joy ## # ... with 187,416 more rows\rStill, there are no edges here - no link between one emotion and the next. Because the data is arranged so that each subsequent row is the next emotion, I can create a new variable, second_emotion, that is the lead of the emotion in that row. Then, I make sure to remove the last row from each participant id (otherwise there would be a relationship between Participant #1’s last emotion and Participant #2’s first emotion).\nemotion_edges \u0026lt;- emotion_long %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(second_emotion = lead(emotion_type)) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(first_emotion = emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(id, Day, Hours, first_emotion, second_emotion) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(id) %\u0026gt;%\rslice(-length(id))\remotion_edges\r## # A tibble: 175,480 x 5\r## # Groups: id [11,332]\r## id Day Hours first_emotion second_emotion\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 1 19 Offense Sadness ## 2 1 1 19 Sadness Disgust ## 3 1 2 14 Disgust Alertness ## 4 1 3 15 Alertness Anxiety ## 5 1 3 15 Anxiety Embarrassment ## 6 1 3 15 Embarrassment Sadness ## 7 1 3 15 Sadness Alertness ## 8 1 4 14 Alertness Embarrassment ## 9 8 2 9 Joy Alertness ## 10 8 2 9 Alertness Alertness ## # ... with 175,470 more rows\rNotice how first and second emotion form a sort of chain - Offense to Sadness, Sadness to Disgust, Disgust to Alertness, etc.\nWe’re ignoring the fact that people are experiencing multiple emotions at once and in those instances we don’t know which emotion was experienced first.\nNow that we have our edges, we need to create an object containing the nodes. This is pretty simple, but I’ll add some information indicating the valence and frequency (n) of each emotion, which will help with the visualizations that follow.\nemotion_nodes \u0026lt;- emotion_long %\u0026gt;%\rcount(emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rrowid_to_column(\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(label = emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(valence = ifelse(label %in% c(\u0026quot;Awe\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Amusement\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Joy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Alertness\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Hope\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Love\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Gratitude\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Pride\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Satisfaction\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;positive\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;negative\u0026quot;))\remotion_nodes\r## # A tibble: 18 x 4\r## id label n valence ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 Alertness 17932 positive\r## 2 2 Amusement 11136 positive\r## 3 3 Anger 6394 negative\r## 4 4 Anxiety 19115 negative\r## 5 5 Awe 3830 positive\r## 6 6 Disdain 682 negative\r## 7 7 Disgust 7412 negative\r## 8 8 Embarrassment 3000 negative\r## 9 9 Fear 3457 negative\r## 10 10 Gratitude 7379 positive\r## 11 11 Guilt 3500 negative\r## 12 12 Hope 16665 positive\r## 13 13 Joy 23465 positive\r## 14 14 Love 18625 positive\r## 15 15 Offense 3160 negative\r## 16 16 Pride 9214 positive\r## 17 17 Sadness 13460 negative\r## 18 18 Satisfaction 19000 positive\rWe now have an object containing our nodes and an object containing our edges.

I’ll note that there are a number of packages for visualizing networks, but ggraph seems to be preferred because it is compatible with ggplot terminology. The function tbl_graph will take the nodes and edges and make them ggraph ready.\nlibrary(tidygraph)\rlibrary(ggraph)\rnetwork \u0026lt;- tbl_graph(emotion_nodes, edges, directed = TRUE)\rset.seed(190318)\rggraph(network, layout = \u0026quot;graphopt\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_edge_link(aes(width = weight, color = scale(weight), alpha = weight), check_overlap = TRUE) +\rscale_edge_color_gradient2(low = \u0026quot;darkgrey\u0026quot;, mid = \u0026quot;#00BFFF\u0026quot;, midpoint = 1.5, high = \u0026quot;dodgerblue2\u0026quot;) +\rscale_edge_width(range = c(.2, 1.75)) +\rgeom_node_label(aes(label = label, fill = valence), size = 4) +\rscale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026quot;#FF6A6A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#43CD80\u0026quot;)) +\rtheme_graph() +\rtheme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;, plot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;))\rStronger relationships show up as thicker lines. Positive emotions seem to be more pronounced and interconnected, which is what was found in the original article. Unfortunately, we don’t get a good sense of temporality (adding directional arrows creates more of a mess than anything). An interactive plot might be more informative, so let’s try that using networkD3.\nlibrary(networkD3)\rnodes_d3 \u0026lt;- emotion_nodes %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(id = id - 1,\rn = (scale(n) + 3)^3)\redges_d3 \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(from = from - 1, to = to - 1,\rweight = ifelse(weight \u0026lt; 600, 0, log(weight)))\rIt’s VERY important to transform the values to base 0, which is why I’m using mutate -1. networkD3 won’t work on base 1 values.\nAgain, I’ve made a few adjustments for visualization purposes. Namely, I’m removing relationships that occur less than 600 times and scaling the values somewhat arbitrarily. Of course, this is exploratory analysis, but caution should be taken when interpreting these results.

Basic sentiment analysis involves extracting and counting emotionally-laden keywords from passages of text (e.g., hate, love, happy, sad). This study describes using sentiment analysis to explore changes in emotion expression in a developmental context. A sample of n = 8,688 poems published online by children and adolescents from Grade 4 to Grade 12 was analyzed. Sentiment analysis coded words as positive or negative and these were averaged within each poem to obtain its relative percentage of positive and negative sentiment. Polynomial regressions explored linear and nonlinear trends in sentiment scores by grade. Among the results, negative sentiment demonstrated an upward curvilinear trend, increasing sharply from Grade 6 to Grade 11 and then decreasing afterward. Positive sentiment demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern throughout development. Overall, these findings are consistent with previous research on the progressions of emotion expression in childhood and adolescence. Despite some limitations, sentiment analysis presents an opportunity for researchers in developmental psychology to explore basic questions in emotional development using large quantities of data.","tags":["Sentiment Analysis","R"],"title":"Using sentiment analysis to detect affect in children’s and adolescents’ poetry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","DG Seguin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549861200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549861200,"objectID":"c823456012b84015636e7ced937dec23","permalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2019/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Shyness is characterized by the experience of heightened fear, anxiety, and social‐evaluative concerns in social situations and is associated with increased risk for social adjustment difficulties. Previous research suggests that shy children have difficulty regulating negative emotions, such as anger and disappointment, which contributes to problems interacting with others. However, it remains unclear precisely which strategies are involved among these associations. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to explore the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies in the links between young children's shyness and social adjustment at preschool. Participants were 248 preschool children aged 2.5 to 5 years. Parents rated children's shyness and emotion regulation strategies in the context of anger and fear. Early childhood educators assessed indices of social adjustment four months later. Among the results, active regulation mediated associations between shyness and subsequent prosocial and socially withdrawn behaviors. Child gender further moderated these linkages, such that the model predicting socially withdrawn behavior was stronger among boys. These results expand on our understanding of emotion regulation strategies in shy children's early socio‐emotional development.","tags":[],"title":"Active emotion regulation mediates links between shyness and social adjustment in preschool","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","Emotion Dynamics"],"content":"\r\rI was recently introduced to Google Dataset Search, an extension that searches for open access datasets. There I stumbled upon this dataset on childrens’ and adult’s ratings of facial expressions. The data comes from a published article by Vesker et al. (2018). Briefly, this study involved having adults and 9-year-old children rate a series of 48 faces on two dimensions of emotion, valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (activated vs. deactivated) (see my previous post for more info on valence and arousal). The authors made some interesting observations about differences in childrens’ and adult’s ratings of these facial expressions.\nHowever, absent from the writeup was a discussion about how reliable these ratings are. We might wonder about the extent to which people agree on the valence or arousal of a face and whether this varies between children and adults. Here, I tackle the issue of intraclass correlation (ICC) using the dataset published by Vesker et al. (2018).

I won’t spend much time discussing mean differences in valence and arousal between children and adults - the original article expands on this. However, I am interested in the variability in ratings of arousal vs. valence.\n\r\rQuantifying Interrater Agreement\rSo far, we’ve created a series of plots showing the variability in childrens’ and adult’s ratings of emotional facial expressions. We get a sense that both children and adults reliably label faces as positive or negative, but they struggle to agree on arousal. Although this is apparent from the plots, we may want to test this more formally. This is actually very important because our estimates of variability (e.g., 95% CI) are sensitive to sample size, which varies by adults and children in this dataset.\nIntra-correlation coefficient (ICC)\rThe ICC is an index of reliability or agreement for continuous ratings. ICCs range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). We will use ICC to quantify agreement on ratings of emotional facial expressions, but ICC is applicable to other situations, such as quantifying heritability or assessing items in a test bank. Here, we will calculate four ICCs: (1) Adult ratings of Valence, (2) Child ratings of Valence, (3) Adults ratings of Arousal, and (4) Child ratings of Arousal.\nShrout and Fleiss (1979), and later McGraw and Wong (1996), describe several different calculations for ICC that depend on the characteristics of the sample. In our case, we will use a two-way random model for single measurements to quantify absolute agreement, also known as ICC2.\nTwo way random, single measures, absolute (ICC2):\n\\[\\rho = \\frac{\\sigma^2_r}{\\sigma^2_r + \\sigma^2_c + \\sigma^2_e}\\]\nWhere \\(\\rho\\) is the population parameter for the ICC, \\(\\sigma^2_r\\) is the row variability (variability between raters), \\(\\sigma^2_c\\) is the column variability (variability between faces), and \\(\\sigma^2_e\\) is the error.\nWe’re using a two way random model because we expect variability between subjects, but also within (faces have different underlying valence and arousal). Also note that the ‘single measures’ part is referring to the fact that each rating is a single score, not an average of scores.\nWe’ll use the ICC function from the psych package to compute the ICCs.\nlibrary(psych)\rVA_adult_icc \u0026lt;- VA_adult %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rVA_child_icc \u0026lt;- VA_child %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rAR_adult_icc \u0026lt;- AR_adult %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rAR_child_icc \u0026lt;- AR_child %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rNow, we’ll use the kableExtra package to generate a table of the results.

Using Cicchetti’s (1994) guidelines, we would interpret the valence ICCs as indicating excellent agreement and the arousal ICCs as poor agreement. It is also worth noting that adults and children seem equally (un)reliable in their reporting.\n\r\rConclusions\rThe findings suggest that we should give pause before attempting to interpret differences between children and adults in their overall ratings of arousal in facial expressions. Such disagreement is actually expected according to dimensional theories of emotion (Russell, 2003) because emotions are not viewed as prototypical things, and there can be wide variability in facial expressions even across similar situations. In other words, there’s no universal facial expression for high arousal (in fact, there’s little reason to believe in universality for any emotional expression).\nReferences\rCicchetti, D. V. (1994).

Russell argued that all emotional experience can be boiled down to two dimensions: valence and arousal, with valence being how positive or negative you feel and arousal being how sluggish or emotionally activated you feel. The emotions we commonly label as anger, sadness, joy, etc. can be mapped within this affective two-dimensional space, such that joy is a high valence, high arousal emotion, whereas boredom is a moderately low valence and low arousal emotion.\nThis kind of model is great in the field of emotion dynamics, where we are interested in how emotions change over time. It’s great because we don’t have to get bogged down in philosophical debates about whether someone is in a state of sadness or not, but can instead focus on quantifying and mapping changes in valence and arousal. For my doctoral dissertation, I’m using the circumplex model of emotions to explore how emotions change over time in instances when people are alone or with others. Briefly, I’m interested in whether being alone reduces arousal (i.e., makes you more calm). Some evidence in support of this is offered in a recent paper by Nguyen, Ryan, \u0026amp; Deci (2018), although they didn’t use a circumplex approach to emotions.\nThe circumplex model shines in another way: because it models emotional states in two dimensions, it can be presented visually. This is what I’m attempting to do for my own research. So for now, I’ll simulate some data akin to what I’ll be analyzing in my dissertation, starting simply with just two time points and one condition. The data will represent participants’ valence and arousal (Likert scale of 1-7) at baseline and the same measurements one hour later.

Developmental psychologists, in particular, seem uncomfortable with removing cases because of the challenges inherent in obtaining data in the first place. However, the process of identifying and (sometimes) removing outliers is not a witch hunt to cleanse datasets of “weird” cases; rather, dealing with outliers is an important step toward solid, reproducible science. As I’ll demonstrate in this simulated example, a few outliers can completely reverse the conclusions derived from statistical analyses.\nlibrary(psych)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(simstudy)\rlibrary(jtools)\rA Hypothetical Case\rI’ll pretend that I have data on participants’ self-reported affinity for aloneness (i.e., how much time they like being alone), time alone (i.e., number of hours typically spent alone per week), and loneliness. We might expect that people who spend more time alone feel more loneliness. However, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys being alone, maybe being by yourself isn’t so bad. In other words, I’m interested in the moderating effect of time alone on the association between affinity for aloneness and loneliness.\n\rGenerating the Data\rI’ll simulate 600 cases using the simstudy package. Because I want the variables correlated, I’ll specify a correlation matrix that makes theoretical sense.\nc \u0026lt;- matrix(c(1, .43, .28, .43, 1, .12, .28, .12, 1), nrow = 3)\rc\r## [,1] [,2] [,3]\r## [1,] 1.00 0.43 0.28\r## [2,] 0.43 1.00 0.12\r## [3,] 0.28 0.12 1.00\rNow, I can use the correlation matrix when I generate the data.

I won’t show the code for this, but all I’ve done is manually change 20 cases.\nLooking at the data again, it’s clear that the outliers have an effect. The sample correlations are still significant, but quite off the mark.\npairs.panels(data_outlier, stars = TRUE)\rModel 1: All Data - Including Outliers\rWhat if we ran a linear regression on these variables? Here, I’ll run a hierarchical linear regression with the first step predicting loneliness from affinity for aloneness and time alone. The second step adds an interaction (this is the moderation I mentioned earlier).\nmodel1 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_outlier)\rsummary(model1)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_outlier)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.99016 -0.48682 0.01538 0.46143 2.48231 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

More importantly though, the interaction is statistically significant with a p-value at .018. We can visualize this more clearly with simple slopes:\nmodel1_int \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ time_alone * alone_affinity, data = data_outlier)\rinteract_plot(model1_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_apa()\rA pristine looking interaction plot! Our simulated data shows that at higher affinity for aloneness the association between time alone and loneliness becomes more negative. This is what was expected.\nIf this were real data, these results are potentially publishable. What is not immediately clear though is that outliers have a severe impact on this finding. Let’s look at the simple slopes a bit differently:\ninteract_plot(model1_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;, linearity.check = TRUE) +\rtheme_apa()\rOh dear… The assumption of linearity for these subsamples is clearly not met. It looks like some cases are skewing the associations among the high and low affinity groups.\n\rModel 2 - Mahalanobis Distance\rA popular way to identify and deal with multivariate outliers is to use Mahalanobis Distance (MD). MD calculates the distance of each case from the central mean. Larger values indicate that a case is farther from where most of the points cluster. The psych package contains a function that quickly calculates and plots MDs:\noutlier(data_outlier)\rWow, one case is way out there, you can hardly see it! Otherwise, most of the points appear to follow in line. We might prefer a more formal test of outliers by using a cut-off score for MD. Here, I’ll recalcuate the MDs using the mahalanobis function and identify those that fall above the cut-off score for a chi-square with k degrees of freedom (3 for 3 variables, but I’ll use ncol in case I want to add or remove variables later):\nmd \u0026lt;- mahalanobis(data, center = colMeans(data_outlier), cov = cov(data_outlier))\ralpha \u0026lt;- .001\rcutoff \u0026lt;- (qchisq(p = 1 - alpha, df = ncol(data_outlier)))\rnames_outliers_MH \u0026lt;- which(md \u0026gt; cutoff)\rexcluded_mh \u0026lt;- names_outliers_MH\rdata_clean_mh \u0026lt;- data_outlier[-excluded_mh, ]\rdata[excluded_mh, ]\r## alone_affinity time_alone loneliness\r## 1: 4.6 1.4 4.2\rUsing this cut-off, only one outlier was identified. Not surprisingly, it’s the case with a huge MD relative to the others. Probing this simulated case closely, we see that this hypothetical individual really likes being alone, spent little time alone, and reported feeling very lonely.\nNow we can rerun the model with this outlier omitted:\nmodel2 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_clean_mh)\rsummary(model2)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_clean_mh)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.98403 -0.48734 0.01331 0.45859 2.48196 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

Many would probably be content to stop here, but we haven’t adequately dealt with the outlier infestation. This demonstrates the fallability of MD, which Leys et al. (2018) argue is not a robust way to determine outliers. The problem lies with the fact that MD uses the means and covariances of all the data - including the outliers - and bases the individual difference scores from these values. If we’re really interested in identifying cases that stray from the pack, it makes more sense to base the criteria for removal using a subset of the data that is the most central. This is the idea behind Minimum Covariance Determinant, which calculates the mean and covariance matrix based on the most central subset of the data.\nWe’ll use this to calculate new distance scores from a 75% subset of the data that is highly central. For this, we need the MASS package. The approach for calculating the distance scores is similar, and we can use the same cut-off score as before.\nlibrary(MASS)\routput75 \u0026lt;- cov.mcd(data_outlier, quantile.used = nrow(data_outlier)*.75)\rmhmcd75 \u0026lt;- mahalanobis(data_outlier, output75$center, output75$cov)\rnames_outlier_MCD75 \u0026lt;- which(mhmcd75 \u0026gt; cutoff)\rexcluded_mcd75 \u0026lt;- names_outlier_MCD75\rdata_clean_mcd \u0026lt;- data_outlier[-excluded_mcd75, ]\rdata_outlier[excluded_mcd75, ]\rThis approach identified 9 outliers, as opposed to the 1 identified with the traditional MD. Let’s see whether removing these cases changes the results:\nmodel3 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_clean_mcd)\rsummary(model3)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_clean_mcd)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.9695 -0.4725 0.0168 0.4519 2.5129 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

Removing 9 data points was enough to decimate the significance of the interaction - the p-value is now .568. This is clearly demonstrated in the simple slopes:\nmodel3_int \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ time_alone * alone_affinity, data = data_clean_mcd)\rinteract_plot(model3_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_apa()\rOf course, this would be a disappointing realization for any researcher. We do see, however, that the correlations are better estimated now that these outliers are removed:\npairs.panels(data_clean_mcd, stars = TRUE)\r\r\rConclusion\rThis simulation was a pathological (but realistic) example of how outliers can dramatically skew results, even with reasonably large samples. The Minimum Covariance Determinant version of MD is a more robust method of identifying and removing outliers that would otherwise go unnoticed with traditional MD.\nMany researchers in psychology are uncomfortable with removing outliers because they worry about losing statistical power. Others feel that removing outliers is in some way dissociating their data from reality because “in the real world, there are outliers - people are different!”. Although true, the argument shouldn’t be about whether outliers exist or not, but how much they impact the conclusions we draw from our data. In this simulation, we saw that a difference of 8 cases out of 600 was enough to turn a non-significant result significant. If our goal is to generalize our findings to a larger population, it would be foolish to do so on the basis of 8 outlying cases.\nThe article by Leys et al. (2018) offers suggestions about how to approach outliers. Ideally, a researcher should pre-register their plan for handling outliers. In a post-hoc situation, they advise publishing results with and without outliers. At the very least, we should be acknowledging outliers, rather than pretending the don’t exist.\nAs a final note, I highly recommend reading the article by Leys et al. (2018). It provides a better theoeretical grasp of MD and MCD. Some of the code used in this example (specifically, the codes for calculating MD and MCD) was used from their article. See below for the full reference.\nReferences\nLeys, C., Klein, O., Dominicy, Y., \u0026amp; Ley, C. (2018). Detecting multivariate outliers: Use a robust variant of Mahalanobis distance.

The Children\u0026rsquo;s Poems (Hipson \u0026amp; Mohammad, 2019) corpus is freely available on my Github.\n","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"fcd9fde7217a46963a2f8aa66fe9e1c4","permalink":"/project/sentiment-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/sentiment-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Identifying emotions in text - on massive scales.","tags":["Sentiment Analysis"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"b10a15cb942f64a2c55723092ecd2489","permalink":"/project/social-development-in-different-cultures/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/social-development-in-different-cultures/","section":"project","summary":"Research on socio-emotional development in different cultures","tags":["Social Development"],"title":"Social Development in Different Cultures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"9505ac3cd505c795e1dfbb350b31c3ba","permalink":"/project/social-withdrawal-and-socio-emotional-development/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/social-withdrawal-and-socio-emotional-development/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the socio-emotional consequences of social withdrawal across development.","tags":["Social Development"],"title":"Social Withdrawal and Socio-emotional Development","type":"project"},{"authors":["J Liu","B Xiao","WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","P Yang","C Cheah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535774400,"objectID":"a12d111d608ba103d805e9c9a921fba3","permalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to intentionally control behavior to achieve specific goals helps children concentrate in school and behave appropriately in social situations. In Chinese culture, where self-regulation is highly valued by parents and teachers, children’s difficulties self-regulating may contribute to increased learning problems and subsequent authoritarian parenting. In this study we explored the longitudinal linkages among Chinese children’s self-regulation, learning problems, and authoritarian parenting using a developmental cascades model. Participants were N = 617 primary school students in Shanghai, P.R. China followed over three years from Grade 3–4 to Grade 5–6. Measures of children’s self-regulation, learning problems, and maternal authoritarian parenting were obtained each year from a combination of child self-reports and maternal and teacher ratings. Among the results: (1) compared with the unidirectional and bidirectional models, the developmental cascades model was deemed the best fit for the data; (2) earlier self-regulation negatively predicted later authoritarian parenting via a pathway through academic performance; (3) academic performance directly and indirectly contributed to greater self-regulation. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of self-regulation for Chinese children’s academic success and authoritarian parenting practices.","tags":[],"title":"Self-regulation, learning problems, and maternal authoritarian parenting in Chinese children: A developmental cascades model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Sette","WE Hipson","F Zava","E Baumgartner","RJ Coplan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515387600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515387600,"objectID":"6960812a1a073e28c62c193a091c2b0c","permalink":"/publication/sette-et-al.-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-08T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sette-et-al.-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of the present study was to examine the moderating role of inhibitory control (IC) in the associations between shyness and young children’s social and school adjustment. Participants were 112 Italian children (M = 56.85 months, SD = 10.14) enrolled in preschool. Parents and teachers assessed child shyness and IC as well as indices of social and school adjustment. Children were interviewed to assess vocabulary. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed several significant interaction effects between shyness and IC in the prediction of outcome variables. Follow-up simple slope analyses indicated that among children with higher levels of IC, shyness was negatively related to prosocial behavior and popularity. In contrast, among children with lower levels of IC, shyness was positively associated with regulated school behaviors. Practice or Policy: The findings provide evidence to suggest that the combination of shyness and IC may contribute to children’s behavioral rigidity, which in turn may promote social and school adjustment difficulties.","tags":[],"title":"Linking shyness with social and school adjustment in early childhood: The moderating role of inhibitory control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Liu","B Xiao","WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","D Li","X Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509508800,"objectID":"05ed29bd3f5d8c66b7fa16c1f607b5fc","permalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2016/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal links among Chinese children's self‐control, social experiences, and loneliness, largely from a developmental cascades perspective (which postulates mechanisms about how effects within a particular domain of functioning can impact across additional domains over time). Participants were N = 1,066 primary school students in Shanghai, P. R. China, who were followed over three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. Measures of children's behavioral self‐control, peer preference, and loneliness were obtained each year from peer nominations and child self‐reports. Results indicated that as compared with the unidirectional and bidirectional models, the developmental cascade model represented the best fit for the data. Within this model, a number of significant direct and indirect pathways were identified among variables and over time. For example, self‐control was found to indirectly contribute to later decreases in loneliness via a pathway through peer preference. As well, peer preference both directly and indirectly contributed to later increases in self‐control. Finally, loneliness directly led to decreases in self‐control from Grade 3 to Grade 4, but not from Grade 4 to Grade 5. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of self‐control for Chinese children's social and emotional functioning over time.","tags":[],"title":"Self-control, peer preference, and loneliness in Chinese children: A three-year longitudinal study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WE Hipson","SL Gardiner","RJ Coplan","LL Ooi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487739600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487739600,"objectID":"fe7474526c8e397ce138e41b5cb96c6d","permalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of this study was to explore associations among maternal agreeableness, child temperament (i.e., emotion dysregulation), and children's social adjustment at school. Participants were 146 children in kindergarten and Grade 1 (76 girls; Mage = 67.78 months, SD = 10.81 months). Mothers provided ratings of their own agreeableness and their child's temperament, and teachers assessed indices of children's socioemotional functioning at school. Among the results, maternal agreeableness moderated associations between child dysregulation and aspects of adjustment at school. Specifically, at higher levels of maternal agreeableness, the relations between child dysregulation and both anxiety with peers and their prosocial behavior were attenuated. Overall, the results suggest that maternal agreeableness may serve as a protective factor for dysregulated children. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Maternal agreeableness moderates associations between young children’s emotion dysregulation and socio-emotional functioning at school","type":"publication"}]
