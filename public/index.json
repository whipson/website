[{"authors":null,"categories":["R","Bayesian","Linear Mixed Models","Multilevel Modeling","Tutorial"],"content":"\rThis past summer, I watched a brilliant lecture series by Richard McElreath on Bayesian statistics. It honestly changed my whole outlook on statistics, so I couldn’t recommend it more (plus, McElreath is an engaging instructor). One of the most compelling cases for using Bayesian statistics is with a collection of statistical tools called linear mixed models or multilevel/hierarchical models. It’s common that data are grouped or clustered in some way. Often in psychology we have repeated observations nested within participants, so we know that data coming from the same participant will share some variance. Linear mixed models are powerful tools for dealing with multilevel data, usually in the form of modeling random intercepts and random slopes. In this tutorial I assume familiarity with linear regression and some background knowledge in Bayesian inference, such that you should have some familiarity with priors and posterior distributions (if not, go here) or watch McElreath’s videos.\nWhy use Bayesian instead of Frequentist statistics? One reason is that prior knowledge about a parameter - for example, it’s distribution - can be incorporated in the model. Another reason especially relevant to linear mixed models is that we can easily include multiple random intercepts and slopes without running into the same stringent sample size requirements as with frequentist approaches. This is not an exhaustive list; more can be found here.\nSetting it All Up\rInstalling and running brms is a bit more complicated than your run-of-the-mill R packages. Because brms uses STAN as its back-end engine to perform Bayesian analysis, you will need to install rstan. Carefully follow the instructions at this link and you should have no problem. Once you’ve done that you should be able to install brms and load it up.\nlibrary(brms)\r## Loading required package: Rcpp\r## Loading \u0026#39;brms\u0026#39; package (version 2.10.0). Useful instructions\r## can be found by typing help(\u0026#39;brms\u0026#39;). A more detailed introduction\r## to the package is available through vignette(\u0026#39;brms_overview\u0026#39;).\rIt’s normal to get some warning messages upon loading the package. That’s fine. We can now load up the tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rThe data is available on GitHub here in a .sav format. You’ll need the haven package to read it into R. Make sure you import it from your working directory or specify the path to your downloads folder.\nlibrary(haven)\rThe dataset was curated by Patrick Curran for the purpose of demonstrating different approaches for handling multilevel, longitudinal data (see here for more info). The dataset consists of 405 children in the first two years of elementary school measured over four assessment points on reading recognition and antisocial behaviour. As well, it included time invariant covariates, such as emotional support and cognitive stimulation. For this post, we’ll focus on reading and cognitive stimulation, and we’ll use Bayesian Linear Mixed Models to address a number of questions about children’s reading ability.\nFor now, we’ll omit assessment periods with missing data, but we’ll return to the issue of missing data at the end of this demonstration.\ncurran_dat \u0026lt;- read_sav(\u0026quot;CurranLong.sav\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(id, occasion, read, homecog) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(complete.cases(.))\rcurran_dat\r## # A tibble: 1,325 x 4\r## id occasion read homecog\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 22 0 2.1 13\r## 2 22 1 3.9 13\r## 3 34 0 2.1 9\r## 4 34 1 2.9 9\r## 5 34 2 4.5 9\r## 6 34 3 4.5 9\r## 7 58 0 2.3 9\r## 8 58 1 4.5 9\r## 9 58 2 4.2 9\r## 10 58 3 4.6 9\r## # ... with 1,315 more rows\rThe data is conveniently in long form already, which means that each row represents a single \\(j^{th}\\) assessment period for an \\(i^{th}\\) child. With no other data cleaning to do, we can move ahead with our research questions.\n\rModel 1: One Random Effect, No Covariates\rWe’ll start with a population-level intercept and a random intercept for participants. Our formula looks like this:\n\\[READ_{ij} = \\beta_0+u_{0i}+\\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nWhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is the population intercept, \\(u_{0i}\\) is a random intercept term for an \\(i^{th}\\) participant, and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is a random noise term for an \\(i^{th}\\) participant and \\(j^{th}\\) assessment period.\nIf you find formulae distasteful, that’s OK. They’re not essential to understanding how linear mixed models work. conceptually, think of the \\(u_{0i}\\) in the above formula as giving a little nudge to the intercept for each participant.\nHere I’ll walk carefully through the brms code and then each subsequent model will just build one this one. We start by providing our data. The family argument is where we supply a distribution for our outcome variable, reading. We’ll use the default gaussian to indicate that reading should be normally distributed. The next line is where we specify our model formula. If you’re familiar with mixed effects models in the lme4 package you’ll be happy to see there are no differences here. I’ve only included the population level intercept ‘1’ after ‘read ~’ to be precise, but this will be included by default. The random intercept is indicated by the ‘(1 | id)’ as in typical mixed effects notation. We then specify some priors. Our first prior is for the population-level Intercept. We’ll specify a fairly wide normal distribution for the intercept.\nIf this whole business of deciding on priors seems strange and arbitrary, just note that a wide prior such as this one will have little bearing on the posterior distribution. If instead we were extremely confident that the intercept was zero, we could use a narrow prior of ‘normal(0, .05)’ which would have a strong effect on the resulting posterior distribution.\nThe next prior is for the standard deviation of the random effects. Unlike an intercept which can be positive or negative, variance (and by association, standard deviation) can only be positive, so we specify a cauchy distribution that constrains the sd to be positive. We do the same for sigma which is the overall variability.\nThe rest of the code has to do with how the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm runs. Without going too much into the whys (a more detailed treatise can be found here), we will run 2,000 chained simulations. The first 1,000 of these will be in the warmup period and we will be rejected. We will run 4 parallel chains on 4 cores (if your computer has fewer cores you will want to reduce this). To help the model converge, I’ve increased the adapt_delta and max_treedepth arguments. Finally, an arbitrary seed number for reproducibility.\nread1 \u0026lt;- brm(data = curran_dat,\rfamily = gaussian,\rformula = read ~ 1 + (1 | id),\rprior = c(prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sd),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma)),\riter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\rcontrol = list(adapt_delta = .975, max_treedepth = 20),\rseed = 190831)\rprint(read1)\r## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: read ~ 1 + (1 | id) ## Data: curran_dat (Number of observations: 1325) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 405) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 0.54 0.08 0.37 0.68 1.00 992 1847\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## Intercept 4.11 0.05 4.01 4.21 1.00 4866 3424\r## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sigma 1.55 0.04 1.48 1.62 1.00 2219 2827\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Eff.Sample ## is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\rWhat does the output tell us? Right away, we see an estimate of an Intercept of 4.11 within a 95% credible interval (you might call it the Bayesian version of a confidence interval, although they’re not quite the same thing) of 4.01 and 4.21. What’s more interesting is the estimate of standard deviation of the random intercepts ‘sd(Intercept)’. So there is person-level variability in reading scores. In turn, sigma is the estimate of the overall variability in reading scores.\nWe can further inspect these estimates by looking at the traceplots and the posterior distributions.\nplot(read1)\rEach row corresponds with a parameter in the model. The traceplot shows the MCMC samples. These should resemble ‘hairy caterpillars’ - we don’t want to see the chain getting stuck near a particular value.\nFor a more intuitive understanding of what the mixed effects model is doing, let’s compare a sample of the observed values with the model predicted values. brms outputs fitted values using the fitted function. We’ll sample 6 participants and see their observed reading scores and model-derived reading scores.\nset.seed(25)\rcurran_dat %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(as_tibble(fitted(read1))) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(id) %\u0026gt;%\rnest() %\u0026gt;%\rsample_n(6) %\u0026gt;%\runnest() %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = read), size = 4, alpha = .75, color = \u0026quot;dodgerblue2\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = Estimate), shape = 1, size = 4, stroke = 1.5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Assessment Period\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Reading Ability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Model 1: One Random Effect, No Covariates\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;Blue points are observed values.

This phenomenon is called partial-pooling or shrinkage. If we’d run the model without the random effect, all of the estimates (black circles) would be on a single horizontal line. But here we have some variation between individuals. Notice too how points further away from the means (population- and cluster-level) are pulled more strongly. However, there is clearly an increase in reading ability over time that is being ignored by this model.\n\rModel 2: Two Random Effects, No Covariates\rLet’s add a random intercept for assessment period (labelled ‘occasion’ in this dataset). This model will recognize that observations are nested within participants and assessment periods. For now, we’ll consider assessment as a random effect because we are still only interested in the variability in reading scores. Here’s our new formula:\n\\[READ_{ij} = \\beta_0+u_{0i}+w_{0j}+\\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nNow we have a term \\(w_{0j}\\) for the random intercept for the \\(j^{th}\\) assessment period.\nThe only change to our model code is that we’ve added a second random intercept: ‘(1 | occasion)’.\nread2 \u0026lt;- brm(data = curran_dat,\rfamily = gaussian,\rread ~ 1 + (1 | id) + (1 | occasion),\rprior = c(prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sd),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma)),\riter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\rcontrol = list(adapt_delta = .975, max_treedepth = 20),\rseed = 190831)\rprint(read2)\r## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: read ~ 1 + (1 | id) + (1 | occasion) ## Data: curran_dat (Number of observations: 1325) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 405) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 0.89 0.04 0.82 0.96 1.00 1270 2122\r## ## ~occasion (Number of levels: 4) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 1.71 0.86 0.79 3.99 1.00 1701 1878\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## Intercept 4.32 0.89 2.46 6.08 1.00 1426 1848\r## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sigma 0.64 0.01 0.61 0.67 1.00 3630 3056\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Eff.Sample ## is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\rLooking again at our output now, we see variability in the random intercepts for id, but even larger variability across occasions (assessment periods). In fact, the overall variability, sigma, is quite reduced from the previous model. This demonstrates an important lesson about mixed models: that they decompose the overall variance (sigma) into cluster-level variance. If we just ran a linear regression, it wouldn’t differentiate between measurement error and variation between participants and time points.\nLet’s again compare the estimates with the observed values. We’ll use the same subsample as before to illustrate the effect of adding a second random effect.\nset.seed(25)\rcurran_dat %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(as_tibble(fitted(read2))) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(id) %\u0026gt;%\rnest() %\u0026gt;%\rsample_n(6) %\u0026gt;%\runnest() %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = read), size = 4, alpha = .75, color = \u0026quot;dodgerblue2\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = Estimate), shape = 1, size = 4, stroke = 1.5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Assessment Period\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Reading Ability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Model 2: Two Random Effects, No Covariates\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;Blue points are observed values.

The fact that the black circles follow a nearly linear increase is telling us that there is probably an effect of time, such that children get better at reading over time.\n\rModel 3: One Random Effect, One Covariate\rNow let’s make a conceptual shift. Maybe as researchers we decide that we’re interested in the effect of time (assessment period) on reading ability. Since each assessment was spaced equally apart in time and we have good reason to think that time has a global effect on reading, it makes sense to include it as a fixed effect (this sort of conceptual decision should be made beforehand, but for illustrative purposes I’ve shown it as a random and a fixed effect).\nIt’s always a good idea to visualize what’s going on so that we know if our assumptions are tenable. we’ll create a lineplot showing the change in reading ability over time, but with each line representing an individual in our sample.\ncurran_dat %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = occasion, y = read, group = id)) +\rgeom_line(size = .75, alpha = .20) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Assessment Period\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Reading Ability\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 16)\rThere’s a clear upward trend - most children improve in their reading over time. We can now proceed with formally testing the growth in reading:\n\\[READ_{ij} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1Time_j+u_{0i}+\\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nHere’s the model code. Note that we are still modeling the random effect of id, but now occasion is a covariate (predictor). We need to specify a new prior, b for beta. The beta estimate for the effect of time on reading ability is assumed to derive from a normal distribution with mean 0 and sd 1.\nread3 \u0026lt;- brm(data = curran_dat,\rfamily = gaussian,\rread ~ 1 + occasion + (1 | id),\rprior = c(prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept),\rprior(normal(0, 1), class = b),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sd),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma)),\riter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\rcontrol = list(adapt_delta = .975, max_treedepth = 20),\rseed = 190831)\rprint(read3)\r## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: read ~ 1 + occasion + (1 | id) ## Data: curran_dat (Number of observations: 1325) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 405) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 0.89 0.04 0.82 0.96 1.00 1204 1906\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## Intercept 2.70 0.05 2.60 2.81 1.00 1036 1692\r## occasion 1.10 0.02 1.07 1.14 1.00 6696 3112\r## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sigma 0.68 0.02 0.65 0.71 1.00 3004 3138\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

We have an estimate of beta as 1.10 within a 95% credible interval of 1.07 and 1.14. So there’s strong evidence of a positive effect of time on reading ability.\nset.seed(25)\rcurran_dat %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(as_tibble(fitted(read3))) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(id) %\u0026gt;%\rnest() %\u0026gt;%\rsample_n(6) %\u0026gt;%\runnest() %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = read), size = 4, alpha = .75, color = \u0026quot;dodgerblue2\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_point(aes(x = occasion, y = Estimate), shape = 1, size = 4, stroke = 1.5) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Assessment Period\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Reading Ability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Model 3: One Random Effect, One Covariate\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;Blue points are observed values.

The main difference now is that the black circles show a strictly linear trend that is the same across participants. But maybe this assumption of equal effects across the board isn’t tenable either.\n\rModel 4: One Random Slope, One Covariate\rLet’s ramp things up by modeling a random slope for each participant:\n\\[READ_{ij} = \\beta_0+u_{0i}+\\beta_1Time_j+u_{1ij}+\\epsilon_{ij}\\]\nWhere \\(u_{1ij}\\) is the random slope for the effect of assessment period between participants.\nA random slope model also has a random intercept, but now, the slope for time on reading ability will be different for each participant: ‘(1 + occasion | id)’. Another change to our model code is a new prior specifying the correlation between the Intercept and the beta for occasion. For an overview of the Cholesky Distribution I’d recommend this post, but all you need to know here is that the higher above 1 the value is, the more “speculative” the model is of strong correlations.\nread4 \u0026lt;- brm(data = curran_dat,\rfamily = gaussian,\rread ~ 1 + occasion + (1 + occasion | id),\rprior = c(prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept),\rprior(normal(0, 1), class = b),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sd),\rprior(cauchy(0, 1), class = sigma),\rprior(lkj_corr_cholesky(1.5), class = cor)),\riter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\rcontrol = list(adapt_delta = .975, max_treedepth = 20),\rseed = 190831)\rprint(read4)\r## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: read ~ 1 + occasion + (1 + occasion | id) ## Data: curran_dat (Number of observations: 1325) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 405) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 0.76 0.04 0.68 0.84 1.00 1279\r## sd(occasion) 0.27 0.02 0.22 0.32 1.00 614\r## cor(Intercept,occasion) 0.29 0.12 0.07 0.53 1.00 664\r## Tail_ESS\r## sd(Intercept) 2218\r## sd(occasion) 1082\r## cor(Intercept,occasion) 1070\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## Intercept 2.70 0.05 2.60 2.79 1.00 1465 2297\r## occasion 1.12 0.02 1.08 1.16 1.00 2963 3299\r## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sigma 0.59 0.02 0.56 0.62 1.00 908 1758\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

The credible interval for the population effect of cognitive stimulation doesn’t include zero, but the evidence is weak that it’s doing anything at all in this model. There’s some indication that the intercepts vary by cognitive stimulation, such that at higher stimulation children have a higher initial reading ability. But there’s no evidence that the slopes vary by cognitive stimulation.\ncurran_dat %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(as_tibble(fitted(read5))) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(homecog_grp = factor(ntile(homecog, 3))) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = occasion, y = Estimate, group = id, color = homecog_grp)) +\rgeom_line(size = .75, alpha = .50) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Assessment Period\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Reading Ability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Cognitive Home Environment\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(~homecog_grp, labeller = as_labeller(c(\u0026quot;1\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Low\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Medium\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;3\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;High\u0026quot;))) +\rguides(color = FALSE) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 14))\r\rModel 6: Dealing with Missing Data\rSo far we’ve been dealing with complete data - where each assessment has no missing values. In doing so, we are effectively claiming that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). This may not be a tenable assumption. Missingness on one variable may be correlated with another variable (Missing at Random; MAR) or, even worse, correlated with the variable itself (Missing Not At Random; MNAR). Without diving into the theoretical aspects of missing data (a more thoughtful discussion can be found here) let’s end by running Bayesian imputation.\ncurran_dat_missing \u0026lt;- read_sav(\u0026quot;CurranLong.sav\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(id, occasion, read, homecog)\rIn brms we indicate missingness with mi(). Here we’re rerunning Model 5, but we’re also imputing missingness on reading ability and cognitive stimulation. We actually have two model formulae - one for each variable in the model with missing data. I’ll also note quickly that we have hidden missingness in this data as missing assessment points do not show up as rows in the dataset. For the purpose of this demonstration, it won’t be a problem, but in the real world, we’d want to impute these as well.\nread6 \u0026lt;- brm(data = curran_dat_missing,\rfamily = gaussian,\rbf(read | mi() ~ 1 + occasion + mi(homecog) + (1 + occasion | id)) +\rbf(homecog | mi() ~ 1) + set_rescor(FALSE),\rprior = c(prior(normal(0, 5), class = Intercept),\rprior(normal(0, 1), class = b),\rprior(lkj_corr_cholesky(1.5), class = cor)),\riter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,\rcontrol = list(adapt_delta = .975, max_treedepth = 20),\rseed = 190831)\rprint(read6)\r## Family: MV(gaussian, gaussian) ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity\r## mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: read | mi() ~ 1 + occasion + mi(homecog) + (1 + occasion | id) ## homecog | mi() ~ 1 ## Data: curran_dat_missing (Number of observations: 1393) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 405) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI\r## sd(read_Intercept) 0.75 0.04 0.68 0.83\r## sd(read_occasion) 0.27 0.02 0.22 0.32\r## cor(read_Intercept,read_occasion) 0.25 0.12 0.03 0.51\r## Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sd(read_Intercept) 1.00 1360 2987\r## sd(read_occasion) 1.01 770 1589\r## cor(read_Intercept,read_occasion) 1.00 960 1492\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\r## read_Intercept 2.15 0.16 1.84 2.47 1.00 2028\r## homecog_Intercept 8.91 0.07 8.77 9.05 1.00 9040\r## read_occasion 1.12 0.02 1.08 1.16 1.00 4599\r## read_mihomecog 0.06 0.02 0.03 0.09 1.00 2066\r## Tail_ESS\r## read_Intercept 2534\r## homecog_Intercept 2687\r## read_occasion 2956\r## read_mihomecog 2596\r## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\r## sigma_read 0.59 0.02 0.56 0.62 1.00 943 2256\r## sigma_homecog 2.57 0.05 2.47 2.66 1.00 12854 2668\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

Our work here is done.\n\rFinal Words\rThis topic is so vast that I couldn’t possibly cover everything there is to say about Bayesian Linear Mixed Models. We only scratched the surface on interpreting Bayesian posteriors. For example, brms offers formal ways of comparing models and I highly recommend looking into these.\rI’m indebted to Richard McElreath’s fantastic lectures series for all that I know on the topic. Honestly, if you can spare the time, they’re so so worth it - plus they’re freely available on YouTube here. Watch these and then follow along with the code in this brms guide here and you’re golden! Finally, if you want a short primer on Bayesian MLM and an excellent guide for writing STAN code (not brms), I’d highly recommend this paper by Sorensen, Hohenstein, and Vasishth (2016). It helped immensely in my ongoing transition from Frequentist to Bayesian statistics.\n\rReferences\rBaldwin, S. (2014). Visualizing the LKJ Correlation Distribution.\nCurran, P. J. (1997).

Whether it’s to finish a paper by the end of the summer or to spend more time with friends and family, goals are what help motivate us to do something. Goals are also intimately tied to our feelings. You may have had the experience of falling behind in your goals, which made you upset, but ultimately motivated you to step up your efforts. Conversely, you could be comfortably ahead of your goals and be tempted to coast for a while (much like the Hare in the Tortoise and the Hare who takes a nap when he is far ahead of the Tortoise).\nCharles Carver presented an elegant model of emotion and behavior as intertwined in nested feedback loops. The idea behind a feedback loop is that you have a system whose output feeds into its input (the typical example being a thermostat). This idea isn’t new (see Powers, 1973), but Carver brilliantly formalized these ideas in this 2015 paper, using process diagrams to illustrate his model. In honor of Dr. Carver who passed away this year, I’m bringing his model to life in the form of a simulation.\nSimple Feedback Loop\rLet’s start with a simple type of feedback loop called a discrepancy-reducing loop. As we’ll see, the term implies that the object of the loop is to reduce a discrepancy between the system’s current state and an optimal, desired state. Imagine we have a goal of running a marathon and we’re tracking our progress toward that goal. Our desired outcome is to be 100% prepared for the marathon (note that we’re considering the act of running the marathon separate). Every day, we’ll compare our current progress to our desired outcome and this comparison will dictate how much effort we put into training that day. It’s easier to see with a process diagram:\n\r{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n\\ndigraph {\\ngraph [overlap = true, fontsize = 20]\\nnode [shape = box,\\n fontname = Helvetica]\\n\\\"Desired Progress\\\"; Behavior; \\\"Current Progress\\\"; \\\"Environment\\\"\\n\\nnode [shape = triangle,\\n fixedsize = true,\\n width = 1.8,\\n height = 1.2]\\nComparison\\n\\\"Desired Progress\\\" - Comparison - Behavior - \\\"Environment\\\" - \\\"Current Progress\\\" - Comparison\\n} \\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\rThis diagram describes a simple feedback loop whereby a Comparison between Current and Desired Progress affects behavior which, in turn, affects progress. We can emulate this in a simulation using R code.\nLet’s return to our example of wannabe marathon runners. We’ll simulate 10 runners whose marathon preparedness progress starts at 0 and maxes out at 1. The code consists of nested loops. In the first loop (denoted by \\(i\\)) we have each of the 10 runners. We initialize their desired condition, which is 1 because they desire to be 100% prepared for the marathon. We then initialize the current condition to 0 to reflect their progress before the simulation starts.\nIn the second loop (denoted by \\(j\\)) we have each of the 100 days nested within each of the 10 runners. Each day, the runner compares their current progress with their desired condition. The larger this difference, the more effort they’ll put into training, which increases their chances of making progress. The closer they are to their goal, the less effort they put in. If one’s effort is successful, they make 2.5% progress, if they are not successful, there is a 50/50 chance that progress will decline by 2.5% or stay at it’s current state.\nprogress \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10)) # initialize an empty dataframe in which to store progress\rset.seed(1678) # for reproducibility\rfor(i in 1:10){\rdesired_condition \u0026lt;- 1 # person desires to complete the task (100% completion)\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- 0 # person starts with 0% completion\rfor(j in 1:100){ behavior \u0026lt;- desired_condition - current_condition # distance between desire and reality\renvironment \u0026lt;- sample(x = c(-.025, 0, .025), size = 1, prob = c(abs(1 - behavior) * .50, abs(1 - behavior) * .50, abs(behavior)))\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- current_condition + environment progress[j, i] \u0026lt;- current_condition\r}\r}\rIf we track progress over each day, here’s what it looks like:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(RColorBrewer)\rprogress \u0026lt;- progress %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(time = 1:100)\rprogress_gathered \u0026lt;- gather(progress, key = \u0026quot;person\u0026quot;, value = \u0026quot;progress\u0026quot;, -time)\rprogress_gathered %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = time, y = progress, group = person)) +\rgeom_line(size = 1.25, color = \u0026quot;dodgerblue2\u0026quot;, alpha = .65) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Day\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Progress toward Goal\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Simple Feedback Loop\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 24) +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))\rEach line represents a person in the simulation. We see a sharp spike in progress during the first 25 days, then it levels off as the runners approach their goal. Admittedly, the example might not perfectly apply to marathon runners, who may actually see less progress early on when they are in poorer physical shape. A more appropriate example might be weight loss, where people are initially highly motivated to lose weight, but then the person reaches an asymptote and less progress is made.\n\rSimple Feedback with an Outer Monitoring Loop\rSo, our first example doesn’t do a great job of simulating human behavior. One major drawback is that progress is only affected by the distance between one’s current state and their desired state. People don’t always use such a wide perspective when contemplating their goals. Recent progress is perhaps more important. In the rhetoric of motivational speakers and self help books: take it one day at a time.\nSo now we’ll incorporate an outer loop that monitors activity in the inner loop that we built earlier. Importantly though, this monitoring will affect stuff in the inner loop, so it’s not just a passive observer. We’re going to add a rate parameter that measures the difference between one’s current progress and their progress of the previous day. This will be compared to their desired rate of progress, which we’ll choose to be 5% across the board. For greater clarity, here’s Carver’s take on how the outer loop functions:\n\r“This second loop essentially checks on how well the first one is doing. Thus, the input for the second loop is a representation of the rate of discrepancy reduction in the action system over time” (emphasis in original).\n— Carver (2015, p. 302)\n\rWe’ll use the word approach to define behavior directed toward a goal. Carver proposed that approach is essentially a discrepancy-reducing behavior (as we’ll see soon, there’s a counterpart to approach that is instrumental to understanding more complex behaviors). So the higher one’s approach, the greater chances are of success. Diagramatically, it looks like this:\n\r{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n\\ndigraph {\\ngraph [overlap = true, fontsize = 20]\\nnode [shape = box,\\n fontname = Helvetica]\\n\\\"Desired Progress\\\"; Behavior; \\\"Current Progress\\\"; \\\"Environment\\\"\\n\\nnode [shape = oval,\\n width = .5]\\n\\\"Desired Rate\\\"; \\\"Current Rate\\\"; \\\"Change in Rate\\\"\\n\\nnode [shape = triangle,\\n fixedsize = true,\\n width = 2.1,\\n height = 1.6]\\n\\\"Comparison A\\\"; \\\"Comparison B\\\"\\n\\\"Desired Progress\\\" - \\\"Comparison A\\\" - Behavior - \\\"Environment\\\" - \\\"Current Progress\\\" - \\\"Comparison A\\\"\\nBehavior - \\\"Current Rate\\\" - \\\"Comparison B\\\"\\n\\\"Desired Rate\\\" - \\\"Comparison B\\\"- \\\"Change in Rate\\\" - \\\"Environment\\\" - \\\"Current Rate\\\"\\n} \\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\rAdding another feedback loop complicates things, but what’s important to see is that the organism is comparing both the overall progress and the rate of progress. We can think of it as reflecting on how well it’s doing - not just how far it is from its goal. Now we can add these parameters to the simulation.\nset.seed(1272)\rprogress \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10))\rfor(i in 1:10){\rdesired_condition \u0026lt;- 1 desired_rate \u0026lt;- .025 # desirable rate of progress (2.5% per instance)\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- 0 rate_comparison \u0026lt;- 1 # person starts with rate comparison of 1\rfor(j in 1:100){ # Inner Loop\rcomparison \u0026lt;- desired_condition - current_condition approach \u0026lt;- comparison * .50 + rate_comparison * .50\renvironment \u0026lt;- sample(x = c(-.025, 0, .025), size = 1, prob = c(abs(1 - approach) * .50, abs(1 - approach) * .50, abs(approach)))\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- current_condition + environment\rprogress[j, i] \u0026lt;- current_condition\r# Outer Loop\rif(j == 1) { current_rate \u0026lt;- 0\r} else {\rcurrent_rate \u0026lt;- progress[j, i] - progress[j - 1, i]\r}\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- desired_rate - current_rate\r}\r}\rAgain, we can look at progress over time. From now on, I’ll use different colors for each person in the simulation.\nprogress \u0026lt;- progress %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(time = 1:100)\rprogress_gathered \u0026lt;- gather(progress, key = \u0026quot;person\u0026quot;, value = \u0026quot;progress\u0026quot;, -time)\rprogress_gathered %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = time, y = progress, color = person)) +\rgeom_line(size = 1.25, alpha = .65) +\rscale_color_brewer(palette = \u0026quot;Spectral\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Day\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Progress toward Goal\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Feedback Loop with Monitoring\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 24) +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),\rlegend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)\rCompared to before, the rate of progress is slower on average. There is also more variation between people, as some achieve 50% progress and others are not much farther from where they started. What’s happening is approach behavior increases when the rate of progress is less than desirable. However, when the rate of progress is greater than desirable, approach behavior decreases. This leads to a fluctuating pattern of ups and downs, similar to what occurs in people who diet.\n\rFeedback Loops and Mood\rIn the last example, we used an Outer Loop to monitor the rate of progress in the system. We can think of mood as a byproduct of this outer loop - our subjective feeling about our progress. When we make progress toward our goals we feel happy and we relax. When we fall behind in our goals we feel upset and increase our efforts.\nNow we’ll add to the outer loop a variable called affect, which is just the psychologist’s way of saying ‘mood’. Unlike my previous emotion simulations, we’ll stick to only one dimension of affect: valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant). High valence means you’re feeling happy, while low valence could mean sadness or anger.\nAffect will be neutral for the first 5 days. After that, affect will be a function of autocorrelation, one’s current rate of progress, and their overall progress slope (i.e., extant rate of progress). The progress slope forecasts one’s overall rate of progress based on how well they’ve done so far. In this way, if someone is progressing at a slow rate, they will feel more negative.\nWe won’t bother with the diagrams from hereout because they become needlessly complicated. What’s important to know is that affect emerges as a byproduct of multiple comparisons between progress and desired progress. Here’s the revised R code for the simulation with affect.\nset.seed(12581)\rprogress \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10))\raffect \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10))\rfor(i in 1:10){\rdesired_condition \u0026lt;- 1\rdesired_rate \u0026lt;- .025\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- 0\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- 1\rvalence_attractor \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0.3, sd = .01) # average emotional state\rfor(j in 1:100){ # Inner Loop\rcomparison \u0026lt;- desired_condition - current_condition\rapproach \u0026lt;- comparison * .50 + rate_comparison * .50\renvironment \u0026lt;- sample(x = c(-.025, 0, .025), size = 1, prob = c(abs(1 - approach) * .50, abs(1 - approach) * .50, abs(approach)))\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- current_condition + environment\rprogress[j, i] \u0026lt;- current_condition\r# Outer Loop\rif(j == 1) {\rcurrent_rate \u0026lt;- 0\r} else {\rcurrent_rate \u0026lt;- progress[j, i] - progress[j - 1, i]\r}\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- desired_rate - current_rate\rprogress_slope \u0026lt;- progress[j, i] - progress[1, i]/(j - 1)\rif(j \u0026lt;= 5) {\raffect[j, i] \u0026lt;- valence_attractor + rnorm(n = 1, mean = valence_attractor, sd = 1) * .01\r} else {\raffect[j, i] \u0026lt;- affect[j - 1, i] * .25 + progress_slope * .50 + (1 - rate_comparison) * .24 + rnorm(n = 1, mean = valence_attractor, sd = 1) * .01\r}\r}\r}\rNow that we have progress and affect, let’s look at them together.

Again, this is reflecting that people feel happier when they are making progress toward their goals. But we know that our mood is more complicated than this. Say we’re competing against others in a diet challenge to see who can lose the most weight over 100 days. If we see that we’re way behind in our progress, with no hope of catching up, we may throw in the towel and quit trying altogether. Indeed, humans are highly attuned to social comparisons, especially in competitive environments.\n\rFeedback Loops, Mood, and Social Comparison\rOur last and most complex simulation will take into account how people’s behavior toward a goal changes when they receive social comparison feedback. If you have no chance winning the competition, why expend effort at all? Things get even more complicated from here, as we now have to create dependence among organisms in the simulation. Before, everyone’s performance was independent; now each new person who enters the simulation becomes aware of their performance relative to their peers’.\nWe add two new parameters. The first, average progress rate, is the average slope of prior runs in the simulation (akin to watching your competitor’s performance and then yourself performing). Indeed, these are not run in parallel, so the first simulated person has no insight into the performance of others, while the second person is only aware of how well the first person did, and so on. The second parameter is relative standing and it is simply the difference between one’s current progress rate and the average progress rate. In general, as relative standing increases (as the distance becomes larger) avoidance behavior increases. This works in two ways: (1) performance exceeds that of others and effort goes down (e.g., coasting) or (2) performance pales relative to others and hopelessness ensues. To model this, at the halfway point, if one’s relative standing is 35% less than the average, that person will effectively give up, saving themselves from severe upset. Indeed, some have suggested that this is an adaptive response because it allows people to reprioritize their efforts (Simon, 1967).\nset.seed(1249)\rprogress \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10))\raffect \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 10))\rfor(i in 1:10){\rdesired_condition \u0026lt;- 1\rdesired_rate \u0026lt;- .050\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- 0\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- 1\rvalence_attractor \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0.3, sd = .01)\raverage_progress_rate \u0026lt;- 0\rrelative_standing \u0026lt;- 1\rfor(j in 1:100){ # Inner Loop\rcomparison \u0026lt;- desired_condition - current_condition\rapproach \u0026lt;- (abs(comparison * .50 + rate_comparison * .50))/(abs(relative_standing) + (comparison * .75 + abs(rate_comparison) * .25))\ravoidance \u0026lt;- (abs(relative_standing))/(abs(relative_standing) + (comparison * .75 + abs(rate_comparison) * .25))\renvironment \u0026lt;- sample(x = c(-.025, 0, .025), size = 1, prob = c(avoidance * .50, avoidance * .50, approach))\rcurrent_condition \u0026lt;- current_condition + environment progress[j, i] \u0026lt;- ifelse(current_condition \u0026lt;= 0, 0, current_condition)\r# Outer Loop\rif(j == 1) {\rcurrent_rate \u0026lt;- 0\r} else {\rcurrent_rate \u0026lt;- progress[j, i] - progress[j - 1, i]\rprogress_slope \u0026lt;- progress[j, i] - progress[1, i]/(j - 1)\rrelative_standing \u0026lt;- progress_slope - average_progress_rate\r}\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- desired_rate - current_rate\rif(j \u0026lt;= 5) {\raffect[j, i] \u0026lt;- valence_attractor + rnorm(n = 1, mean = valence_attractor, sd = 1) * .01\r} else if (j \u0026gt;= 50 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; relative_standing \u0026lt;= .35) {\rdesired_condition \u0026lt;- current_condition\rrate_comparison \u0026lt;- 0\raffect[j, i] \u0026lt;- affect[j - 1, i] * .99 + rnorm(n = 1, mean = valence_attractor, sd = 1) * .01\r} else {\raffect[j, i] \u0026lt;- affect[j - 1, i] * .25 + progress_slope * .50 + relative_standing * .24 + rnorm(n = 1, mean = valence_attractor, sd = 1) * .01\r}\r}\rif(i \u0026gt; 1){\raverage_progress_rate \u0026lt;- mean(t(progress[100, (i - 1):1]))\r} else {\raverage_progress_rate \u0026lt;- 0\r}\r}\rRunning the code above, we can enter it into the next code chunk to get the plots.

Of course, human behavior is exceedingly more complicated, but we can learn a lot by simulating ersatz humans with only a handful of parameters. As I continue to work toward my PhD, my appreciation for Carver’s computational models only grows stronger. My goal is to see psychological research and computer simulations partake in their own form of feedback loop, where knowledge from the former feeds into our construction of the latter.\n\rReferences\rCarver, C.

Sometimes our feelings are quite stable, but other times capricious. Measuring and predicting these patterns for different people is somewhat of a Holy Grail for emotion researchers. In particular, some researchers are aspiring to discover mathematical laws that capture the complexity of our inner emotional experiences - much like physicists divining the laws that govern objects in the natural environment. These discoveries would revolutionize our understanding of our everyday feelings and when our emotions can go awry.\nThis series of blog posts, which I kicked off earlier this month with a simulation of emotions during basketball games, is inspired by researchers like Peter Kuppens and Tom Hollenstein (to name a few) who have collected and analyzed reams of intensive self-reports on people’s feelings from one moment to the next. My approach is to reverse engineer these insights and generate models that simulate emotions evolving over time - like this:\nAffective State Space\rWe start with the affective state space - the theoretical landscape on which our conscious feelings roam free. This space is represented as two-dimensional, although we acknowledge that this fails to capture all aspects of conscious feeling. The first dimension, represented along the x-axis, is valence and this refers to how unpleasant vs. pleasant we feel. The second dimension, represented along the y-axis, is arousal. Somewhat less intuitive, arousal refers to how deactivated/sluggish/sleepy vs. activated/energized/awake we feel. At any time, our emotional state can be defined in terms of valence and arousal. So if you’re feeling stressed you would be low in valence and high in arousal. Let’s say you’re serene and calm, then you would be high in valence and low in arousal. Most of the time, we feel moderately high valence and moderate arousal (i.e., content), but if you’re the type of person who is chronically stressed, this would be different.\nThis is all well and good when we think about how we’re feeling right now, but it’s also worth considering how our emotions are changing. On a regular day, our emotions undergo minor fluctuations - sometimes in response to minor hassles or victories, and sometimes for no discernible reason. In this small paragraph, I’ve laid out a number of parameters, all of which vary between different people:\n\rAttractor: Our typical emotional state. At any given moment, our feelings are pulled toward this state. Some people tend to be happier, whereas others are less happy.\rStability: How emotionally stable one is. Some people are more emotionally stable than others. Even in the face of adversity, an emotionally stable person keeps their cool.\rDispersion: The range of our emotional landscape. Some people experience intense highs and lows, whereas others persist somewhere in the middle.\r\rWe’ll keep all of this in mind for the simulation. We’ll start with a fairly simple simulation with 100 hypothetical people. We’ll need the following packages.\nlibrary(psych)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(sn)\rAnd then we’ll create a function that performs the simulation. Note that each person i has their own attractor, recovery rate, stability, and dispersion. For now we’ll just model random fluctuations in emotions, a sort of Brownian motion. You can imagine our little simulatons (fun name for the hypothetical people in the simulation) sitting around on an average day doing nothing in particular.\nsimulate_affect \u0026lt;- function(n = 2, time = 250, negative_event_time = NULL) {\rdt \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = time, ncol = 1))\rcolnames(dt) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;\rdt$time \u0026lt;- 1:time\rvalence \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = time, ncol = 0))\rarousal \u0026lt;- data.frame(matrix(nrow = time, ncol = 0))\rfor(i in 1:n) {\rattractor_v \u0026lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 3.35, sd = .75)\rinstability_v \u0026lt;- sample(3:12, 1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.18, .22, .18, .15, .8, .6, .5, .4, .2, .1))\rdispersion_v \u0026lt;- abs(rsn(1, xi = .15, omega = .02, alpha = -6) * instability_v) #rsn simulates a skewed distribution.\rif(!is.null(negative_event_time)) {\rrecovery_rate \u0026lt;- sample(1:50, 1, replace = TRUE) + negative_event_time\rnegative_event \u0026lt;- (dt$time %in% negative_event_time:recovery_rate) * seq.int(50, 1, -1)\r}\relse {\rnegative_event \u0026lt;- 0\r}\rvalence[[i]] \u0026lt;- ksmooth(x = dt$time,\ry = (negative_event * -.10) + arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0),\rar = .50),\rn = time),\rbandwidth = time/instability_v, kernel = \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot;)$y * dispersion_v + attractor_v #instability is modelled in the bandwidth term of ksmooth, such that higher instability results in higher bandwidth (greater fluctuation). #dispersion scales the white noise (arima) parameter, such that there are higher peaks and troughs at higher dispersion.\rattractor_a \u0026lt;- rnorm(1, mean = .50, sd = .75) + sqrt(instability_v) #arousal attractor is dependent on instability.

In the function simulate_affect, there’s an optional argument negative_event_time that causes a negative event to occur at the specified time. For this, we need to consider one more emotion dynamics parameter:\n\rRecovery rate: How quickly one recovers from an emotional event. If something bad happens, how long does it take to return to the attractor. You can see how I’ve modelled this parameter in the function above.\r\rSo we’ll run the simulation with a negative event arising at t = 150. The negative event will cause a downward spike in valence and an upward spike in arousal.\nemotions_event \u0026lt;- simulate_affect(n = 100, time = 300, negative_event_time = 150)\remotions_event_long \u0026lt;- emotions_event %\u0026gt;%\rgather(key, value, -time) %\u0026gt;%\rseparate(key, into = c(\u0026quot;dimension\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;person\u0026quot;), sep = \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rspread(dimension, value) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(person) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(rmssd_v = rmssd(valence),\rrmssd_a = rmssd(arousal),\rrmssd_total = mean(rmssd_v + rmssd_a)) %\u0026gt;%\rungroup()\remotions_event_long %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = time, y = valence, group = person, color = rmssd_v)) +\rgeom_line(size = .75, alpha = .75) +\rscale_color_gradient2(low = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, mid = \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, midpoint = median(emotions_event_long$rmssd_v)) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Time\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Valence\u0026quot;,\rcolor = \u0026quot;Instability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Simulated Valence Scores over Time for 100 People\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 16)\remotions_event_long %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = time, y = arousal, group = person, color = rmssd_a)) +\rgeom_line(size = .75, alpha = .75) +\rscale_color_gradient2(low = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, mid = \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, midpoint = median(emotions_event_long$rmssd_a)) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Time\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Arousal\u0026quot;,\rcolor = \u0026quot;Instability\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Simulated Arousal Scores over Time for 100 People\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 16)\rIt’s pretty clear that something bad happened.

As of now, all the simulatons return to their baseline attractor, but we would realistically expect some to stay stressed or gloomy following bad news. In the coming months I’ll be looking into how to incorporate emotion regulation into the simulation. For example, maybe some of the simulatons use better coping strategies than others? I’m also interested in incorporating appraisal mechanisms that allow for different reactions depending on the type of emotional stimulus.\n\rReferences\rKuppens, P., Oravecz, Z., \u0026amp; Tuerlinckx, F.

The emotional ups and downs are especially clear among invested fans. Fans experience the joy and excitement of a triumphant comeback, or the anxiety and disappointment of a loss. It is particularly interesting to see how emotions differ from two opposing fan groups watching the same match.\nI decided to perform some simulations on how a crowd of fans would react during a basketball game. Why basketball? Two reasons: First is the frequency of scoring (more baskets = more reactive simulation), and second is that the NBA finals are in swing at time of writing.\nBelow I’ve described the parameters of the simulation in detail and provided reproducible code for all examples, but here’s the quick and dirty. I’m simulating fans’ happiness and nerves (valence and arousal). Happiness reflects baskets scored (up for team basket and down for enemy basket) and overall team performance. Nerves reflects baskets scored, time remaining in game, and the difference between score (higher for closer game). There are other parameters involved that are described in more detail below.\nLet’s run the simulation! I’m simulating a short game that’s about 16 minutes long, but the simulation is sped up. There are 25 fans per team with each dot representing a fan. Blue dots root for the blue team and red dots for red. In this game, blue starts ahead, but red makes a rallying comeback.\nWhat are we seeing here? As the game progresses, fans move into different emotional states. I’ve used the terms content, disappointed, nervous, and excited as helpful placeholders, but we should think of these in terms of varying along dimensions of valence (e.g., happiness) and arousal (e.g., nerves, excitedness). For example, when their team is doing well, fans are happier, but they’re only excited when the score is close. For each basket, there’s a brief spike in arousal and happiness. As the game draws closer to an end, fans get more excited/anxious, especially if the score is close.\nSo how would this play out if one team decimated the other? Let’s give the red team a slight edge over blue:\nNotice how ‘excited’ becomes ‘content’ and ‘nervous’ turns to ‘disappointment’ because the difference becomes insurmountable for the blue team. We can plug in any numbers for this function to produce different results. However, the algorithm is highly sensitive to small changes in scoring chance because this is calculated for every second of the game.\nGoing Behind the Simulation\rSkip this if you have no interest in the psychology of emotions. What I’m striving to simulate are the laws of emotion dynamics (Kuppens \u0026amp; Verduyn, 2017). Emotions change from moment to moment, but there’s also some stability from one moment to the next. Apart from when a basket is scored, most fans cluster around a particular state (this is called an attractor state). Any change is attributable to random fluctuations (e.g., one fan spills some of their beer, maybe another fan sees an amusing picture of a cat on their phone). When a basket is scored, this causes a temporary fluctuation away from the attractor state, after which people resort back to their attractor. More gradual situational factors result in small changes in attractors too. This is why arousal tends to increase with closer games and when the game is approaching the end.\nDetailed Aspects of Simulation and Code\rThere are two parts to this simulation. Part 1 simulates a basketball game for a specified duration of time (n_seconds) and specified probabilities of scoring. The simulation is also designed with a small post game period - sort of like a cool down after the game. During the post game, fans’ arousal returns to baseline.\nThe second and more complicated part of the simulation is the emotional part. Each fan has a score on valence and arousal at each second. These can be further broken down into fixed effects and random effects. The fixed effect for valence is described as follows:\n\\[Valence = 3 + \\beta_{1overall.difference}(.20) + \\beta_{2recent.score(1.5 + \\frac{current.time}{total.time})} - \\beta_{3recent.enemy.score}\\]\nThe fixed effect for arousal looks like this:\n\\[Arousal = 3 + \\beta_{1 (\\frac{current.time}{total.time})(.75)(post.game)} + \\beta_{2(1 - \\sqrt{|difference|})} + \\beta_{3|recent.basket|}\\]\nThe exact values for these coefficients are somewhat arbitrary. They resulted from a lot of trial and error to identify which best simulated emotion dynamics.\nEach fan’s valence and arousal is calculated using the above equations + variability. The variability is added by applying random variation to the first constant in the above equations and white noise with a simulated ARIMA model. On top of this, I used a kernel regression smoother to smooth out each fan’s trajectory. To simulate delayed reaction time to baskets, I added some lags at random intervals - otherwise the simulated fans appear to react quicker than the score board. Here’s what all of this looks like for one fan’s valence over time:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rgame_long %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(fan == 1,\rteam == \u0026quot;team1\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = second, y = valence)) +\rgeom_line(color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, size = 1) +\rtheme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Fan One\u0026#39;s Valence over Time\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Time\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Valence\u0026quot;) +\rtheme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;,\raxis.title.x = element_text(size = 18),\raxis.title.y = element_text(size = 18),\rplot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = .5))\rWe can see this across all fans as well:\ngame_long %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = instance, color = team)) +\rgeom_line(aes(y = valence), alpha = .65) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Valence over Time\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Time\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Valence\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rtheme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;,\raxis.title.x = element_text(size = 18),\raxis.title.y = element_text(size = 18),\rplot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = .5))\rAnd for arousal…\ngame_long %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = instance, color = team)) +\rgeom_line(aes(y = arousal), alpha = .65) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Arousal over Time\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Time\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Arousal\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rtheme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;,\raxis.title.x = element_text(size = 18),\raxis.title.y = element_text(size = 18),\rplot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = .5))\rFor those interested, here’s the full code for the simulation and first animation.

LPA assumes that there are unobserved latent profiles that generate patterns of responses on indicator items.\nHere, I will go through a quick example of LPA to identify groups of people based on their interests/hobbies. The data comes from the Young People Survey, available freely on Kaggle.com.\nHere’s a sneak peek at what we’re going for:\nTerminology note: People use the terms clusters, profiles, classes, and groups interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. I’ll mostly stick to profile to refer to a grouping of cases, in keeping with LPA terminology. We should note that LPA is a branch of Gaussian Finite Mixture Modeling, which includes Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The difference between LPA and LCA is conceptual, not computational: LPA uses continuous indicators and LCA uses binary indicators. LPA is a probabilistic model, which means that it models the probability of case belonging to a profile. This is superior to an approach like K-means that uses distance algorithms.\nWith that aside, let’s load in the data.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rsurvey \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whipson/tidytuesday/master/young_people.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(History:Pets)\rThe data is on 32 interests/hobbies. Each item is ranked 1 (not interested) to 5 (very interested).\nThe description on Kaggle suggests there may be careless responding (e.g., participants who selected the same value over and over). We can use the careless package to identify “string responding”. Let’s also look for multivariate outliers with Mahalanobis Distance (see my previous post on Mahalanobis for identifying outliers).\nlibrary(careless)\rlibrary(psych)\rinterests \u0026lt;- survey %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(string = longstring(.)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(md = outlier(., plot = FALSE))\rWe’ll cap string responding to a maximum of 10 and use a Mahalanobis D cutoff of alpha = .001.\ncutoff \u0026lt;- (qchisq(p = 1 - .001, df = ncol(interests)))\rinterests_clean \u0026lt;- interests %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(string \u0026lt;= 10,\rmd \u0026lt; cutoff) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-string, -md)\rThe package mclust performs various types of model-based clustering and dimension reduction. Plus, it’s really intuitive to use. It requires complete data (no missing), so for this example we’ll remove cases with NAs. This is not the preferred approach; we’d be better off imputing. But for illustrative purposes, this works fine. I’m also going to standardize all of the indicators so when we plot the profiles it’s clearer to see the differences between clusters. Running this code will take a few minutes.\nlibrary(mclust)\rinterests_clustering \u0026lt;- interests_clean %\u0026gt;%\rna.omit() %\u0026gt;%\rmutate_all(list(scale))\rBIC \u0026lt;- mclustBIC(interests_clustering)\rWe’ll start by plotting Bayesian Information Criteria for all the models with profiles ranging from 1 to 9.\nplot(BIC)\rIt’s not immediately clear which model is the best since the y-axis is so large and many of the models score close together. summary(BIC) shows the top three models based on BIC.\nsummary(BIC)\r## Best BIC values:\r## VVE,3 VEE,3 EVE,3\r## BIC -75042.7 -75165.1484 -75179.165\r## BIC diff 0.0 -122.4442 -136.461\rThe highest BIC comes from VVE, 3. This says there are 3 clusters with variable volume, variable shape, equal orientation, and ellipsodial distribution (see Figure 2 from this paper for a visual). However, VEE, 3 is not far behind and actually may be a more theoretically useful model since it constrains the shape of the distribution to be equal. For this reason, we’ll go with VEE, 3.\nIf we want to look at this model more closely, we save it as an object and inspect it with summary().\nmod1 \u0026lt;- Mclust(interests_clustering, modelNames = \u0026quot;VEE\u0026quot;, G = 3, x = BIC)\rsummary(mod1)\r## ---------------------------------------------------- ## Gaussian finite mixture model fitted by EM algorithm ## ---------------------------------------------------- ## ## Mclust VEE (ellipsoidal, equal shape and orientation) model with 3\r## components: ## ## log-likelihood n df BIC ICL\r## -35455.83 874 628 -75165.15 -75216.14\r## ## Clustering table:\r## 1 2 3 ## 137 527 210\rThe output describes the geometric characteristics of the profiles and the number of cases classified into each of the three clusters.\nBIC is one of the best fit indices, but it’s always recommended to look for more evidence that the solution we’ve chosen is the correct one. We can also compare values of the Integrated Completed Likelikood (ICL) criterion. See this paper for more details. ICL isn’t much different from BIC, except that it adds a penalty on solutions with greater entropy or classification uncertainty.\nICL \u0026lt;- mclustICL(interests_clustering)\rplot(ICL)\rsummary(ICL)\r## Best ICL values:\r## VVE,3 VEE,3 EVE,3\r## ICL -75134.69 -75216.13551 -75272.891\r## ICL diff 0.00 -81.44795 -138.203\rWe see similar results. ICL suggests that model VEE, 3 fits quite well. Finally, we’ll perform the Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT) which compares model fit between k-1 and k cluster models. In other words, it looks to see if an increase in profiles increases fit. Based on simulations by Nylund, Asparouhov, and Muthén (2007) BIC and BLRT are the best indicators for how many profiles there are. This line of code will take a long time to run, so if you’re just following along I suggest skipping it unless you want to step out for a coffee break.\nmclustBootstrapLRT(interests_clustering, modelName = \u0026quot;VEE\u0026quot;)\r## ------------------------------------------------------------- ## Bootstrap sequential LRT for the number of mixture components ## ------------------------------------------------------------- ## Model = VEE ## Replications = 999 ## LRTS bootstrap p-value\r## 1 vs 2 197.0384 0.001\r## 2 vs 3 684.8743 0.001\r## 3 vs 4 -124.1935 1.000\rBLRT also suggests that a 3-profile solution is ideal.\n##Visualizing LPA\nNow that we’re confident in our choice of a 3-profile solution, let’s plot the results. Specifically, we want to see how the profiles differ on the indicators, that is, the items that made up the profiles. If the solution is theoretically meaningful, we should see differences that make sense.\nFirst, we’ll extract the means for each profile (remember, we chose these to be standardized). Then, we melt this into long form.

Emotion Dynamics tells us that different emotions are highly interconnected, such that one emotion morphs into another and so on. I’ll be using a large dataset from an original study published in PLOS ONE by Trampe, Quoidbach, and Taquet (2015). Thanks to Google Dataset Search, I was able to locate this data. The data is collected from 11,000 participants who completed daily questionnaires on the emotions they felt at a given moment. The original paper is fascinating and I highly encourage checking it out - not to mention that the author’s analysis is the inspiration for this post. The raw data can be freely accessed from the author’s OSF page (link in online article) - props to them for publishing the data!\nWhat is a network? In a sentence, a network is a complex set of interrelations between variables. Some terminology: nodes are the variables (in this case, emotions), and edges are the relationships between the variables. Networks can be directed, which means that variables are linked in a sequence (e.g, from emotion A to emotion B), or undirected, which just shows the relationships. Trampe et al. (2015) created an undirected network in their paper, but the data also allows for a directed network - and this is what I’m going to make for this post.\nFirst, I’ll read in the data and fix up a few spelling errors from the original dataset.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\remotion_raw \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://osf.io/e7uab/download\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(Offense = Ofense,\rEmbarrassment = Embarassment)\remotion_raw\r## # A tibble: 69,544 x 21\r## id Hours Day Pride Love Hope Gratitude Joy Satisfaction Awe\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 2 1 14 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 3 1 14 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 4 1 14 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 5 1 15 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 6 1 15 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 7 1 19 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## 8 8 8 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\r## 9 8 9 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\r## 10 8 10 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r## # ... with 69,534 more rows, and 11 more variables: Amusement \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Alertness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Anxiety \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Disdain \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Offense \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Guilt \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Disgust \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Fear \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Embarrassment \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # Sadness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Anger \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\rThe data is formatted as a sparse matrix (lots of zeros). We have participant id, Day, and Hour that the emotion was reported. To make this data network compatible, I need to wrangle it into a dataframe of edges - that is a from column and a to column. This will become more apparent shortly.\nI can use the function gather to turn the data into long format. By filtering for values of 1, I remove all the zeros from the sparse matrix and I’m left with a column that includes the emotion that was experienced at the time of reporting.\nemotion_long \u0026lt;- emotion_raw %\u0026gt;%\rgather(emotion_type, value, Pride:Anger) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(id, Day) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(value == 1) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-value)\remotion_long\r## # A tibble: 187,426 x 4\r## id Hours Day emotion_type ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 19 1 Offense ## 2 1 19 1 Sadness ## 3 1 14 2 Disgust ## 4 1 15 3 Alertness ## 5 1 15 3 Anxiety ## 6 1 15 3 Embarrassment\r## 7 1 15 3 Sadness ## 8 1 14 4 Alertness ## 9 1 14 4 Embarrassment\r## 10 8 9 2 Joy ## # ... with 187,416 more rows\rStill, there are no edges here - no link between one emotion and the next. Because the data is arranged so that each subsequent row is the next emotion, I can create a new variable, second_emotion, that is the lead of the emotion in that row. Then, I make sure to remove the last row from each participant id (otherwise there would be a relationship between Participant #1’s last emotion and Participant #2’s first emotion).\nemotion_edges \u0026lt;- emotion_long %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(second_emotion = lead(emotion_type)) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(first_emotion = emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(id, Day, Hours, first_emotion, second_emotion) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(id) %\u0026gt;%\rslice(-length(id))\remotion_edges\r## # A tibble: 175,480 x 5\r## # Groups: id [11,332]\r## id Day Hours first_emotion second_emotion\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 1 19 Offense Sadness ## 2 1 1 19 Sadness Disgust ## 3 1 2 14 Disgust Alertness ## 4 1 3 15 Alertness Anxiety ## 5 1 3 15 Anxiety Embarrassment ## 6 1 3 15 Embarrassment Sadness ## 7 1 3 15 Sadness Alertness ## 8 1 4 14 Alertness Embarrassment ## 9 8 2 9 Joy Alertness ## 10 8 2 9 Alertness Alertness ## # ... with 175,470 more rows\rNotice how first and second emotion form a sort of chain - Offense to Sadness, Sadness to Disgust, Disgust to Alertness, etc.\nWe’re ignoring the fact that people are experiencing multiple emotions at once and in those instances we don’t know which emotion was experienced first.\nNow that we have our edges, we need to create an object containing the nodes. This is pretty simple, but I’ll add some information indicating the valence and frequency (n) of each emotion, which will help with the visualizations that follow.\nemotion_nodes \u0026lt;- emotion_long %\u0026gt;%\rcount(emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rrowid_to_column(\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rrename(label = emotion_type) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(valence = ifelse(label %in% c(\u0026quot;Awe\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Amusement\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Joy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Alertness\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Hope\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Love\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Gratitude\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Pride\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Satisfaction\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;positive\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;negative\u0026quot;))\remotion_nodes\r## # A tibble: 18 x 4\r## id label n valence ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 Alertness 17932 positive\r## 2 2 Amusement 11136 positive\r## 3 3 Anger 6394 negative\r## 4 4 Anxiety 19115 negative\r## 5 5 Awe 3830 positive\r## 6 6 Disdain 682 negative\r## 7 7 Disgust 7412 negative\r## 8 8 Embarrassment 3000 negative\r## 9 9 Fear 3457 negative\r## 10 10 Gratitude 7379 positive\r## 11 11 Guilt 3500 negative\r## 12 12 Hope 16665 positive\r## 13 13 Joy 23465 positive\r## 14 14 Love 18625 positive\r## 15 15 Offense 3160 negative\r## 16 16 Pride 9214 positive\r## 17 17 Sadness 13460 negative\r## 18 18 Satisfaction 19000 positive\rWe now have an object containing our nodes and an object containing our edges.

I’ll note that there are a number of packages for visualizing networks, but ggraph seems to be preferred because it is compatible with ggplot terminology.

Positive emotions seem to be more pronounced and interconnected, which is what was found in the original article. Unfortunately, we don’t get a good sense of temporality (adding directional arrows creates more of a mess than anything). An interactive plot might be more informative, so let’s try that using networkD3.\nlibrary(networkD3)\rnodes_d3 \u0026lt;- emotion_nodes %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(id = id - 1,\rn = (scale(n) + 3)^3)\redges_d3 \u0026lt;- edges %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(from = from - 1, to = to - 1,\rweight = ifelse(weight \u0026lt; 600, 0, log(weight)))\rIt’s VERY important to transform the values to base 0, which is why I’m using mutate -1. networkD3 won’t work on base 1 values.\nAgain, I’ve made a few adjustments for visualization purposes. Namely, I’m removing relationships that occur less than 600 times and scaling the values somewhat arbitrarily. Of course, this is exploratory analysis, but caution should be taken when interpreting these results.

Basic sentiment analysis involves extracting and counting emotionally-laden keywords from passages of text (e.g., hate, love, happy, sad). This study describes using sentiment analysis to explore changes in emotion expression in a developmental context. A sample of n = 8,688 poems published online by children and adolescents from Grade 4 to Grade 12 was analyzed. Sentiment analysis coded words as positive or negative and these were averaged within each poem to obtain its relative percentage of positive and negative sentiment. Polynomial regressions explored linear and nonlinear trends in sentiment scores by grade. Among the results, negative sentiment demonstrated an upward curvilinear trend, increasing sharply from Grade 6 to Grade 11 and then decreasing afterward. Positive sentiment demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern throughout development. Overall, these findings are consistent with previous research on the progressions of emotion expression in childhood and adolescence. Despite some limitations, sentiment analysis presents an opportunity for researchers in developmental psychology to explore basic questions in emotional development using large quantities of data.","tags":["Sentiment Analysis","R"],"title":"Using sentiment analysis to detect affect in children’s and adolescents’ poetry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","DG Seguin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549861200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549861200,"objectID":"c823456012b84015636e7ced937dec23","permalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2019/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Shyness is characterized by the experience of heightened fear, anxiety, and social‐evaluative concerns in social situations and is associated with increased risk for social adjustment difficulties. Previous research suggests that shy children have difficulty regulating negative emotions, such as anger and disappointment, which contributes to problems interacting with others. However, it remains unclear precisely which strategies are involved among these associations. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to explore the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies in the links between young children's shyness and social adjustment at preschool. Participants were 248 preschool children aged 2.5 to 5 years. Parents rated children's shyness and emotion regulation strategies in the context of anger and fear. Early childhood educators assessed indices of social adjustment four months later. Among the results, active regulation mediated associations between shyness and subsequent prosocial and socially withdrawn behaviors. Child gender further moderated these linkages, such that the model predicting socially withdrawn behavior was stronger among boys. These results expand on our understanding of emotion regulation strategies in shy children's early socio‐emotional development.","tags":[],"title":"Active emotion regulation mediates links between shyness and social adjustment in preschool","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","Emotion Dynamics"],"content":"\r\rI was recently introduced to Google Dataset Search, an extension that searches for open access datasets. There I stumbled upon this dataset on childrens’ and adult’s ratings of facial expressions. The data comes from a published article by Vesker et al. (2018). Briefly, this study involved having adults and 9-year-old children rate a series of 48 faces on two dimensions of emotion, valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (activated vs. deactivated) (see my previous post for more info on valence and arousal). The authors made some interesting observations about differences in childrens’ and adult’s ratings of these facial expressions.\nHowever, absent from the writeup was a discussion about how reliable these ratings are. We might wonder about the extent to which people agree on the valence or arousal of a face and whether this varies between children and adults. Here, I tackle the issue of intraclass correlation (ICC) using the dataset published by Vesker et al. (2018).

I won’t spend much time discussing mean differences in valence and arousal between children and adults - the original article expands on this. However, I am interested in the variability in ratings of arousal vs. valence.\n\r\rQuantifying Interrater Agreement\rSo far, we’ve created a series of plots showing the variability in childrens’ and adult’s ratings of emotional facial expressions. We get a sense that both children and adults reliably label faces as positive or negative, but they struggle to agree on arousal. Although this is apparent from the plots, we may want to test this more formally. This is actually very important because our estimates of variability (e.g., 95% CI) are sensitive to sample size, which varies by adults and children in this dataset.\nIntra-correlation coefficient (ICC)\rThe ICC is an index of reliability or agreement for continuous ratings. ICCs range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). We will use ICC to quantify agreement on ratings of emotional facial expressions, but ICC is applicable to other situations, such as quantifying heritability or assessing items in a test bank. Here, we will calculate four ICCs: (1) Adult ratings of Valence, (2) Child ratings of Valence, (3) Adults ratings of Arousal, and (4) Child ratings of Arousal.\nShrout and Fleiss (1979), and later McGraw and Wong (1996), describe several different calculations for ICC that depend on the characteristics of the sample. In our case, we will use a two-way random model for single measurements to quantify absolute agreement, also known as ICC2.\nTwo way random, single measures, absolute (ICC2):\n\\[\\rho = \\frac{\\sigma^2_r}{\\sigma^2_r + \\sigma^2_c + \\sigma^2_e}\\]\nWhere \\(\\rho\\) is the population parameter for the ICC, \\(\\sigma^2_r\\) is the row variability (variability between raters), \\(\\sigma^2_c\\) is the column variability (variability between faces), and \\(\\sigma^2_e\\) is the error.\nWe’re using a two way random model because we expect variability between subjects, but also within (faces have different underlying valence and arousal). Also note that the ‘single measures’ part is referring to the fact that each rating is a single score, not an average of scores.\nWe’ll use the ICC function from the psych package to compute the ICCs.\nlibrary(psych)\rVA_adult_icc \u0026lt;- VA_adult %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rVA_child_icc \u0026lt;- VA_child %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rAR_adult_icc \u0026lt;- AR_adult %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rAR_child_icc \u0026lt;- AR_child %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-face) %\u0026gt;%\rICC()\rNow, we’ll use the kableExtra package to generate a table of the results.

Using Cicchetti’s (1994) guidelines, we would interpret the valence ICCs as indicating excellent agreement and the arousal ICCs as poor agreement. It is also worth noting that adults and children seem equally (un)reliable in their reporting.\n\r\rConclusions\rThe findings suggest that we should give pause before attempting to interpret differences between children and adults in their overall ratings of arousal in facial expressions. Such disagreement is actually expected according to dimensional theories of emotion (Russell, 2003) because emotions are not viewed as prototypical things, and there can be wide variability in facial expressions even across similar situations. In other words, there’s no universal facial expression for high arousal (in fact, there’s little reason to believe in universality for any emotional expression).\nReferences\rCicchetti, D. V. (1994).

Russell argued that all emotional experience can be boiled down to two dimensions: valence and arousal, with valence being how positive or negative you feel and arousal being how sluggish or emotionally activated you feel. The emotions we commonly label as anger, sadness, joy, etc. can be mapped within this affective two-dimensional space, such that joy is a high valence, high arousal emotion, whereas boredom is a moderately low valence and low arousal emotion.\nThis kind of model is great in the field of emotion dynamics, where we are interested in how emotions change over time. It’s great because we don’t have to get bogged down in philosophical debates about whether someone is in a state of sadness or not, but can instead focus on quantifying and mapping changes in valence and arousal. For my doctoral dissertation, I’m using the circumplex model of emotions to explore how emotions change over time in instances when people are alone or with others. Briefly, I’m interested in whether being alone reduces arousal (i.e., makes you more calm). Some evidence in support of this is offered in a recent paper by Nguyen, Ryan, \u0026amp; Deci (2018), although they didn’t use a circumplex approach to emotions.\nThe circumplex model shines in another way: because it models emotional states in two dimensions, it can be presented visually. This is what I’m attempting to do for my own research. So for now, I’ll simulate some data akin to what I’ll be analyzing in my dissertation, starting simply with just two time points and one condition. The data will represent participants’ valence and arousal (Likert scale of 1-7) at baseline and the same measurements one hour later.

Developmental psychologists, in particular, seem uncomfortable with removing cases because of the challenges inherent in obtaining data in the first place. However, the process of identifying and (sometimes) removing outliers is not a witch hunt to cleanse datasets of “weird” cases; rather, dealing with outliers is an important step toward solid, reproducible science. As I’ll demonstrate in this simulated example, a few outliers can completely reverse the conclusions derived from statistical analyses.\nlibrary(psych)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(simstudy)\rlibrary(jtools)\rA Hypothetical Case\rI’ll pretend that I have data on participants’ self-reported affinity for aloneness (i.e., how much time they like being alone), time alone (i.e., number of hours typically spent alone per week), and loneliness. We might expect that people who spend more time alone feel more loneliness. However, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys being alone, maybe being by yourself isn’t so bad. In other words, I’m interested in the moderating effect of time alone on the association between affinity for aloneness and loneliness.\n\rGenerating the Data\rI’ll simulate 600 cases using the simstudy package. Because I want the variables correlated, I’ll specify a correlation matrix that makes theoretical sense.\nc \u0026lt;- matrix(c(1, .43, .28, .43, 1, .12, .28, .12, 1), nrow = 3)\rc\r## [,1] [,2] [,3]\r## [1,] 1.00 0.43 0.28\r## [2,] 0.43 1.00 0.12\r## [3,] 0.28 0.12 1.00\rNow, I can use the correlation matrix when I generate the data.

I won’t show the code for this, but all I’ve done is manually change 20 cases.\nLooking at the data again, it’s clear that the outliers have an effect. The sample correlations are still significant, but quite off the mark.\npairs.panels(data_outlier, stars = TRUE)\rModel 1: All Data - Including Outliers\rWhat if we ran a linear regression on these variables? Here, I’ll run a hierarchical linear regression with the first step predicting loneliness from affinity for aloneness and time alone. The second step adds an interaction (this is the moderation I mentioned earlier).\nmodel1 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_outlier)\rsummary(model1)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_outlier)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.99016 -0.48682 0.01538 0.46143 2.48231 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

More importantly though, the interaction is statistically significant with a p-value at .018. We can visualize this more clearly with simple slopes:\nmodel1_int \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ time_alone * alone_affinity, data = data_outlier)\rinteract_plot(model1_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_apa()\rA pristine looking interaction plot! Our simulated data shows that at higher affinity for aloneness the association between time alone and loneliness becomes more negative. This is what was expected.\nIf this were real data, these results are potentially publishable. What is not immediately clear though is that outliers have a severe impact on this finding. Let’s look at the simple slopes a bit differently:\ninteract_plot(model1_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;, linearity.check = TRUE) +\rtheme_apa()\rOh dear… The assumption of linearity for these subsamples is clearly not met. It looks like some cases are skewing the associations among the high and low affinity groups.\n\rModel 2 - Mahalanobis Distance\rA popular way to identify and deal with multivariate outliers is to use Mahalanobis Distance (MD). MD calculates the distance of each case from the central mean. Larger values indicate that a case is farther from where most of the points cluster. The psych package contains a function that quickly calculates and plots MDs:\noutlier(data_outlier)\rWow, one case is way out there, you can hardly see it! Otherwise, most of the points appear to follow in line. We might prefer a more formal test of outliers by using a cut-off score for MD. Here, I’ll recalcuate the MDs using the mahalanobis function and identify those that fall above the cut-off score for a chi-square with k degrees of freedom (3 for 3 variables, but I’ll use ncol in case I want to add or remove variables later):\nmd \u0026lt;- mahalanobis(data, center = colMeans(data_outlier), cov = cov(data_outlier))\ralpha \u0026lt;- .001\rcutoff \u0026lt;- (qchisq(p = 1 - alpha, df = ncol(data_outlier)))\rnames_outliers_MH \u0026lt;- which(md \u0026gt; cutoff)\rexcluded_mh \u0026lt;- names_outliers_MH\rdata_clean_mh \u0026lt;- data_outlier[-excluded_mh, ]\rdata[excluded_mh, ]\r## alone_affinity time_alone loneliness\r## 1: 4.6 1.4 4.2\rUsing this cut-off, only one outlier was identified. Not surprisingly, it’s the case with a huge MD relative to the others. Probing this simulated case closely, we see that this hypothetical individual really likes being alone, spent little time alone, and reported feeling very lonely.\nNow we can rerun the model with this outlier omitted:\nmodel2 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_clean_mh)\rsummary(model2)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_clean_mh)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.98403 -0.48734 0.01331 0.45859 2.48196 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

Many would probably be content to stop here, but we haven’t adequately dealt with the outlier infestation. This demonstrates the fallability of MD, which Leys et al. (2018) argue is not a robust way to determine outliers. The problem lies with the fact that MD uses the means and covariances of all the data - including the outliers - and bases the individual difference scores from these values. If we’re really interested in identifying cases that stray from the pack, it makes more sense to base the criteria for removal using a subset of the data that is the most central. This is the idea behind Minimum Covariance Determinant, which calculates the mean and covariance matrix based on the most central subset of the data.\nWe’ll use this to calculate new distance scores from a 75% subset of the data that is highly central. For this, we need the MASS package. The approach for calculating the distance scores is similar, and we can use the same cut-off score as before.\nlibrary(MASS)\routput75 \u0026lt;- cov.mcd(data_outlier, quantile.used = nrow(data_outlier)*.75)\rmhmcd75 \u0026lt;- mahalanobis(data_outlier, output75$center, output75$cov)\rnames_outlier_MCD75 \u0026lt;- which(mhmcd75 \u0026gt; cutoff)\rexcluded_mcd75 \u0026lt;- names_outlier_MCD75\rdata_clean_mcd \u0026lt;- data_outlier[-excluded_mcd75, ]\rdata_outlier[excluded_mcd75, ]\rThis approach identified 9 outliers, as opposed to the 1 identified with the traditional MD. Let’s see whether removing these cases changes the results:\nmodel3 \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ .*time_alone, data = data_clean_mcd)\rsummary(model3)\r## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = loneliness ~ . * time_alone, data = data_clean_mcd)\r## ## Residuals:\r## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.9695 -0.4725 0.0168 0.4519 2.5129 ## ## Coefficients:\r## Estimate Std.

Removing 9 data points was enough to decimate the significance of the interaction - the p-value is now .568. This is clearly demonstrated in the simple slopes:\nmodel3_int \u0026lt;- lm(loneliness ~ time_alone * alone_affinity, data = data_clean_mcd)\rinteract_plot(model3_int, pred = \u0026quot;time_alone\u0026quot;, modx = \u0026quot;alone_affinity\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_apa()\rOf course, this would be a disappointing realization for any researcher. We do see, however, that the correlations are better estimated now that these outliers are removed:\npairs.panels(data_clean_mcd, stars = TRUE)\r\r\rConclusion\rThis simulation was a pathological (but realistic) example of how outliers can dramatically skew results, even with reasonably large samples. The Minimum Covariance Determinant version of MD is a more robust method of identifying and removing outliers that would otherwise go unnoticed with traditional MD.\nMany researchers in psychology are uncomfortable with removing outliers because they worry about losing statistical power. Others feel that removing outliers is in some way dissociating their data from reality because “in the real world, there are outliers - people are different!”. Although true, the argument shouldn’t be about whether outliers exist or not, but how much they impact the conclusions we draw from our data. In this simulation, we saw that a difference of 8 cases out of 600 was enough to turn a non-significant result significant. If our goal is to generalize our findings to a larger population, it would be foolish to do so on the basis of 8 outlying cases.\nThe article by Leys et al. (2018) offers suggestions about how to approach outliers. Ideally, a researcher should pre-register their plan for handling outliers. In a post-hoc situation, they advise publishing results with and without outliers. At the very least, we should be acknowledging outliers, rather than pretending the don’t exist.\nAs a final note, I highly recommend reading the article by Leys et al. (2018). It provides a better theoeretical grasp of MD and MCD. Some of the code used in this example (specifically, the codes for calculating MD and MCD) was used from their article. See below for the full reference.\nReferences\nLeys, C., Klein, O., Dominicy, Y., \u0026amp; Ley, C. (2018). Detecting multivariate outliers: Use a robust variant of Mahalanobis distance.

The Children\u0026rsquo;s Poems (Hipson \u0026amp; Mohammad, 2019) corpus is freely available on my Github.\n","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"fcd9fde7217a46963a2f8aa66fe9e1c4","permalink":"/project/sentiment-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/sentiment-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Identifying emotions in text - on massive scales.","tags":["Sentiment Analysis"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"b10a15cb942f64a2c55723092ecd2489","permalink":"/project/social-development-in-different-cultures/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/social-development-in-different-cultures/","section":"project","summary":"Research on socio-emotional development in different cultures","tags":["Social Development"],"title":"Social Development in Different Cultures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547010000,"objectID":"9505ac3cd505c795e1dfbb350b31c3ba","permalink":"/project/social-withdrawal-and-socio-emotional-development/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/social-withdrawal-and-socio-emotional-development/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the socio-emotional consequences of social withdrawal across development.","tags":["Social Development"],"title":"Social Withdrawal and Socio-emotional Development","type":"project"},{"authors":["J Liu","B Xiao","WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","P Yang","C Cheah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535774400,"objectID":"a12d111d608ba103d805e9c9a921fba3","permalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to intentionally control behavior to achieve specific goals helps children concentrate in school and behave appropriately in social situations. In Chinese culture, where self-regulation is highly valued by parents and teachers, children’s difficulties self-regulating may contribute to increased learning problems and subsequent authoritarian parenting. In this study we explored the longitudinal linkages among Chinese children’s self-regulation, learning problems, and authoritarian parenting using a developmental cascades model. Participants were N = 617 primary school students in Shanghai, P.R. China followed over three years from Grade 3–4 to Grade 5–6. Measures of children’s self-regulation, learning problems, and maternal authoritarian parenting were obtained each year from a combination of child self-reports and maternal and teacher ratings. Among the results: (1) compared with the unidirectional and bidirectional models, the developmental cascades model was deemed the best fit for the data; (2) earlier self-regulation negatively predicted later authoritarian parenting via a pathway through academic performance; (3) academic performance directly and indirectly contributed to greater self-regulation. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of self-regulation for Chinese children’s academic success and authoritarian parenting practices.","tags":[],"title":"Self-regulation, learning problems, and maternal authoritarian parenting in Chinese children: A developmental cascades model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Sette","WE Hipson","F Zava","E Baumgartner","RJ Coplan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515387600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515387600,"objectID":"6960812a1a073e28c62c193a091c2b0c","permalink":"/publication/sette-et-al.-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-08T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sette-et-al.-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of the present study was to examine the moderating role of inhibitory control (IC) in the associations between shyness and young children’s social and school adjustment. Participants were 112 Italian children (M = 56.85 months, SD = 10.14) enrolled in preschool. Parents and teachers assessed child shyness and IC as well as indices of social and school adjustment. Children were interviewed to assess vocabulary. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed several significant interaction effects between shyness and IC in the prediction of outcome variables. Follow-up simple slope analyses indicated that among children with higher levels of IC, shyness was negatively related to prosocial behavior and popularity. In contrast, among children with lower levels of IC, shyness was positively associated with regulated school behaviors. Practice or Policy: The findings provide evidence to suggest that the combination of shyness and IC may contribute to children’s behavioral rigidity, which in turn may promote social and school adjustment difficulties.","tags":[],"title":"Linking shyness with social and school adjustment in early childhood: The moderating role of inhibitory control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Liu","B Xiao","WE Hipson","RJ Coplan","D Li","X Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509508800,"objectID":"05ed29bd3f5d8c66b7fa16c1f607b5fc","permalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2016/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal links among Chinese children's self‐control, social experiences, and loneliness, largely from a developmental cascades perspective (which postulates mechanisms about how effects within a particular domain of functioning can impact across additional domains over time). Participants were N = 1,066 primary school students in Shanghai, P. R. China, who were followed over three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. Measures of children's behavioral self‐control, peer preference, and loneliness were obtained each year from peer nominations and child self‐reports. Results indicated that as compared with the unidirectional and bidirectional models, the developmental cascade model represented the best fit for the data. Within this model, a number of significant direct and indirect pathways were identified among variables and over time. For example, self‐control was found to indirectly contribute to later decreases in loneliness via a pathway through peer preference. As well, peer preference both directly and indirectly contributed to later increases in self‐control. Finally, loneliness directly led to decreases in self‐control from Grade 3 to Grade 4, but not from Grade 4 to Grade 5. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of self‐control for Chinese children's social and emotional functioning over time.","tags":[],"title":"Self-control, peer preference, and loneliness in Chinese children: A three-year longitudinal study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WE Hipson","SL Gardiner","RJ Coplan","LL Ooi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487739600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487739600,"objectID":"fe7474526c8e397ce138e41b5cb96c6d","permalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hipson-et-al.-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of this study was to explore associations among maternal agreeableness, child temperament (i.e., emotion dysregulation), and children's social adjustment at school. Participants were 146 children in kindergarten and Grade 1 (76 girls; Mage = 67.78 months, SD = 10.81 months). Mothers provided ratings of their own agreeableness and their child's temperament, and teachers assessed indices of children's socioemotional functioning at school. Among the results, maternal agreeableness moderated associations between child dysregulation and aspects of adjustment at school. Specifically, at higher levels of maternal agreeableness, the relations between child dysregulation and both anxiety with peers and their prosocial behavior were attenuated. Overall, the results suggest that maternal agreeableness may serve as a protective factor for dysregulated children. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Maternal agreeableness moderates associations between young children’s emotion dysregulation and socio-emotional functioning at school","type":"publication"}]
