      <description>In psychology, we increasingly encounter data that is nested. It is to the point now where any quantitative psychologist worth their salt must know how to analyze multilevel data. A common approach to multilevel modeling is the varying effects approach, where the relation between a predictor and an outcome variable is modeled both within clusters of data (e.g., observations within people, or children within schools) and across the sample as a whole.</description>

      <description>A Markov Chain describes a sequence of states where the probability of transitioning from states depends only the current state. Markov chains are useful in a variety of computer science, mathematics, and probability contexts, also featuring prominently in Bayesian computation as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Here, weâ€™re going to look at a relatively simple breed of Markov chain and build up some intuition using simulations and animations (two of my favorite things).</description>

      <title>An Intuitive Look at Binomial Probability in a Bayesian Context</title>

      <description>Binomial probability is the relatively simple case of estimating the proportion of successes in a series of yes/no trials. The perennial example is estimating the proportion of heads in a series of coin flips where each trial is independent and has possibility of heads or tails. Because of its relative simplicity, the binomial case is a great place to start when learning about Bayesian analysis. In this post, I will provide a gentle introduction to Bayesian analysis using binomial probability as an example.</description>
