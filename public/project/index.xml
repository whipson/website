      <description>We often think of emotions as being there one moment and gone the next. However, we are always experiencing some sort of emotion - whether it&amp;rsquo;s boiling anger or vapid listlessness. The study of emotion dynamics is all about how emotions change over time. Emotions can change from one moment to the next - intensifying or deintensifying. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring what predicts these complex changes. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in whether solitude impacts our emotional state.</description>

      <description>In the era of Big Data, we are awash in online textual data, such as Tweets, Google Books, and countless blogs. These sources represent a wealth of data. Sentiment analysis is a technique that automatically assesses the emotional content of text. In partnership with Dr. Saif Mohammad of the National Research Council Canada, I&amp;rsquo;m using sentiment analysis on thousands of online poetry submitted by children and adolescents. The goal of this project is to provide insight into how emotions change over developmental time.</description>
